Gu@@ ta@@ ch : increased safety for pedestri@@ ans
they are not even 100 metres apart : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorf@@ park@@ platz in Gu@@ ta@@ ch became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights .
two sets of lights so close to one another : inten@@ tional or just a sil@@ ly error ?
yesterday , Gu@@ ta@@ cht &apos;s Mayor gave a clear answer to this question .
&quot; at the time , the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route , &quot; explained Eck@@ ert yesterday .
the Kl@@ user lights protect cycli@@ sts , as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Ber@@ gle .
the system , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the Sul@@ zb@@ ach@@ weg / Kir@@ ch@@ strasse junction .
we have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; Gru@@ b &apos; residential area .
&quot; at times of high road and pedestrian traffic , an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety , &quot; said Eck@@ ert .
this was also confirmed by Peter Arn@@ old from the Off@@ enburg District Office .
&quot; according to current measurements , around 12@@ ,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gu@@ ta@@ ch on the B@@ 33 on a daily basis , of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent , &quot; emphasised Arn@@ old .
therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary : &quot; here safety comes first , it &apos;s that simple , &quot; said Arn@@ old .
a total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a round@@ about was also considered , however , this idea was rejected on account of the nar@@ ro@@ wn@@ ess of the Sul@@ zb@@ ach@@ weg / Kir@@ ch@@ strasse jun@@ ctions .
according to Arn@@ old , every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts : &quot; using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree tr@@ un@@ ks , we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sul@@ zb@@ ach@@ weg without kno@@ cking over the traffic light posts . &quot;
the traffic light system itself , which cost around EUR 15@@ ,000 , is the &quot; most modern system that is currently available on the market , &quot; explained Arn@@ old .
the system is fitted with coloured LE@@ Ds , which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights , even when the sun is low in the sky .
and they are also energy @-@ efficient : the older light systems consu@@ me around 100 Wat@@ ts , with the new ones consuming just eight .
there are three sets of lights per direction of travel .
Arn@@ old explained the technology used by the new system : it is fitted with two ra@@ dar sensors .
if the pedestrian pres@@ ses the button at the traffic lights , the top ra@@ dar sensor checks the traffic status .
if the street is clear , the pedestrian ob@@ tains a green light immediately , if not , there is a delay of around 15 seconds .
an additional ra@@ dar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .
&quot; if a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended , thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street , &quot; explained Arn@@ old .
of course , drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road .
yesterday this was not the case : the light had barely turned green for pedestri@@ ans when a luxury vehicle sp@@ ed through on a red light .
for more than 30 years , Josef Win@@ kler has been writing from the heart , telling of the hard@@ ships of his childhood and youth .
the catastrop@@ hes of his Catholic village up@@ bringing - the spee@@ ch@@ less@@ ness , his tendency towards bru@@ te force and dul@@ led sexu@@ ality , the con@@ fin@@ ement and lack of joy - all of this has been described many times by the Ka@@ ern@@ ten @-@ born po@@ et .
the BÃ¼@@ chner pri@@ ze@@ winner is known primarily as a writer of pro@@ se , with theatre texts something of a r@@ arity for him .
in a col@@ lage of pro@@ se texts For his performance piece , &quot; Wetter@@ leu@@ chten auf der Z@@ un@@ gen@@ spitze &quot; ( Summer ligh@@ tn@@ ing on the tip of your tongue ) , which can now be seen in Garage X on Pe@@ ter@@ splatz , Ger@@ hard Fres@@ acher , creates a col@@ lage of pro@@ se texts .
the theatre producer has thus combined elements from the auto@@ bi@@ ographi@@ cally inspired novel &quot; Der Lei@@ bei@@ gene &quot; ( 1987 ) &#91; The Bon@@ ds@@ man &#93; featuring pro@@ se mini@@ atures from &quot; Lei@@ chn@@ am , seine Familie bel@@ au@@ ern@@ d &quot; ( 2003 ) &#91; Cor@@ pse , stal@@ king his family &#93; .
on the predomin@@ antly empty stage - with one important requirement : a cru@@ m@@ pled sofa , on which cast members all@@ ude to cop@@ ul@@ ating and ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ating - the eight @-@ person en@@ semble work their way through the text material .
however , Director Fres@@ acher seems to have little trust in the text .
the 70 @-@ minute performance g@@ losses over the script with a host of director &apos;s addi@@ tions , well @-@ known from the re@@ pertoire of post @-@ dramatic theat@@ rical styles .
in particular , the ac@@ tre@@ sses play a major role in the sometimes rather dubi@@ ous st@@ aging .
they are man@@ handled , their heads held under water , tack@@ ed to the wall by their evening go@@ wns .
wra@@ pped in cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ ane or in gir@@ d@@ les , they stum@@ ble on danger@@ ously high he@@ els across the set , either delivering mon@@ olo@@ gues at the top of their voices or lying completely silent on the stage .
however , the source text makes barely any reference to this intense delivery .
the best moments of the evening is when the singing starts - tracks range from Deep Pur@@ ple to traditional folk songs .
only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down , and we see f@@ las@@ hes of Win@@ kler &apos;s somewhat absurd sense of hum@@ our .
a black box in your car ?
as America &apos;s road plann@@ ers struggle to find the cash to mend a cru@@ mb@@ ling highway system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits ne@@ at@@ ly by the d@@ ash@@ board of your car .
the devices , which track every mile a motor@@ ist drives and trans@@ mit that information to bureau@@ crats , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to over@@ hau@@ l the out@@ dated system for funding America &apos;s major roads .
the usually d@@ ull arena of highway planning has suddenly sp@@ aw@@ ned intense debate and color@@ ful alli@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lob@@ b@@ ying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
the tea party is ag@@ hast .
the American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
and while Congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
they are exploring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
thousands of mot@@ ori@@ sts have already taken the black boxes , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive .
this really is a must for our nation .
&quot; it is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said Has@@ an I@@ k@@ hr@@ ata , executive director of the Southern California Ass@@ n@@ . of Govern@@ ments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 .
there is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
the technology is there to do it .
the push comes as the country &apos;s High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .
Americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .
cars get many more miles to the gall@@ on .
the federal tax itself , 18.@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has@@ n &apos;t gone up in 20 years .
politicians are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one pen@@ ny when gas prices are high .
&quot; the gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said Lee Mun@@ n@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the University of M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota .
his state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay @-@ by @-@ mile system .
&quot; this works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
won@@ ks call it a mile@@ age @-@ based user fee .
it is no surprise that the idea appe@@ als to urban liber@@ als , as the taxes could be ri@@ gged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce con@@ gestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
California plann@@ ers are looking to the system as they dev@@ ise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
but Rep@@ . Bill S@@ hu@@ ster ( R @-@ P@@ a . ) , chairman of the House Transpor@@ tation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long @-@ term alternative .
the free mark@@ e@@ te@@ ers at the Re@@ as@@ on Foundation are also f@@ ond of having drivers pay per mile .
&quot; this is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adri@@ an Mo@@ ore , vice president of policy at Re@@ as@@ on .
people are paying more directly into what they are getting .
the movement is also bol@@ stered by two former U.S. Transpor@@ tation secre@@ t@@ aries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay @-@ per @-@ mile direction .
the U.S. Senate approved a $ 90 @-@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .
but the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constitu@@ ents whose daily lives often involve log@@ ging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
the most e@@ ager is O@@ reg@@ on , which is en@@ listing 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .
those drivers will soon pay the mile@@ age fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot .
new York City is looking into one .
Il@@ lin@@ ois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .
and the I @-@ 95 Co@@ alition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Se@@ aboard ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ inia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in Nevada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; concerns about Big Bro@@ ther and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said Al@@ au@@ d@@ din K@@ han , who direc@@ ts strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transpor@@ tation .
it was not something people wanted .
as the trial got underway , the AC@@ L@@ U of Nevada warned on its website : &quot; it would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full @-@ fle@@ dged tracking devices . &quot;
there is no need to build an enormous , un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday com@@ ings and go@@ ings .
Nevada is among several states now scra@@ mb@@ ling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
if you can do that , K@@ han said , the public gets more comfortable .
the hun@@ t for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California star@@ tup called Tru@@ e Mi@@ le@@ age .
the firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
it was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mile@@ age .
but the devices it is testing appeal to highway plann@@ ers because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , up@@ loaded periodi@@ cally by mo@@ dem .
&quot; people will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said Ry@@ an Mor@@ ris@@ on , chief executive of Tru@@ e Mi@@ le@@ age .
there have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
there are a lot less expensive and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to do this .
in O@@ reg@@ on , plann@@ ers are experim@@ enting with giving drivers different choices .
they can choose a device with or without GPS .
or they can choose not to have a device at all , op@@ ting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
other places are hoping to sell the concept to a war@@ y public by having the devices do more , not less .
in New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real @-@ time speed data from other drivers that mot@@ ori@@ sts could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; mot@@ ori@@ sts would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
some transportation plann@@ ers , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant di@@ stra@@ ction .
at the Metro@@ politan Transpor@@ tation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bank@@ rupt High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund by raising gas taxes .
an extra one @-@ time or annual lev@@ y could be imposed on drivers of hybri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; there is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an asp@@ ir@@ in , &quot; said Rand@@ y R@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .
if we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
KÃ¶ni@@ gs@@ feld : small team gives a spir@@ ited performance
the voluntary fire service bra@@ vely came through the main autumn test run in spite of a lack of personnel .
only eleven men took part in the exercise .
for the training exercise , department comm@@ ander , Hans Kam@@ mer@@ er , chose the Fe@@ der premises on Burg@@ berger Strasse .
a short @-@ circuit was reported to have occurred there during sa@@ wing .
two people were injured by the resulting fire and the spread of smoke , however , one was able to make an emergency call .
two fire figh@@ ters equipped with resp@@ ir@@ atory gear prepared to enter the building following the initial inspection of the situation by Hans Kam@@ mer@@ er .
after a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building .
the second person had to be carried .
this was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow sta@@ ir@@ well .
the building , a workshop with integrated stab@@ ling for two horses , was not easy to secure .
there were large quantities of wood and bal@@ es of stra@@ w stored inside .
in addition to this , there were also electrical machines for wood processing .
the first attempt to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fire was made using the tank on the fire engine .
another line was taken from the surface hy@@ d@@ rant around 100 metres away .
only three attempts could be made to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the bla@@ ze .
a hol@@ low @-@ stream no@@ zzle in the building was also used .
for Hans Kam@@ mer@@ er , the exercise was also a chance to show what can be achieved with just a few available staff .
in case of emergency , support is provided by the KÃ¶ni@@ gs@@ feld day@@ time task force .
the Commander expressed his satisfaction following the exercise .
networking between universities and companies is important
on a visit to the district of Bre@@ is@@ gau @-@ Hoch@@ sch@@ war@@ zw@@ ald , it was explained to Parliamentary President Gui@@ do Wolf in T@@ iti@@ see @-@ Neu@@ stadt where the workforce of tomorrow will come from .
in the Hoch@@ sch@@ war@@ zw@@ ald Support Centre , he addressed this important question alongside the executive princip@@ als of the vocational col@@ leg@@ es and the district gram@@ mar school and the chairs of the parents &apos; council .
&quot; education is an important factor for the location , &quot; highlighted Clau@@ dia Ste@@ h@@ le , Director of the Hans Th@@ oma School , which introduced the net@@ worked Hoch@@ sch@@ war@@ zw@@ ald Education Centre Scho@@ ols Project .
during the presentation , Wolf seemed impressed by the educational pilot project .
since 2011 , there has been successful collaboration in W@@ Ã¤l@@ der@@ stadt between the Support Centre , the District Gra@@ mm@@ ar School and the V@@ oc@@ ational School Com@@ plex .
he also pra@@ ised the family @-@ friendly approach within the district .
&quot; it is important , not only to keep the family life stage in mind , but , on account of demographic change , the period spent providing long @-@ term care and support for relatives as well , &quot; explained Wolf .
he also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long @-@ term care and support of relatives .
&quot; without support from their employer , the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract , &quot; said Wolf .
however , nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , &quot; he added .
another , particularly important factor is that of networking between universities and companies .
&quot; after all , people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the region , along with their acquired knowledge and skills , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , &quot; said the State Parliamentary President , expressing his thorough conviction .
for it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be covered .
in his opinion , the district &apos;s advantage as a location is its advanta@@ geous location in south @-@ west Germany , in immediate proximity to France and Switzerland .
in addition to this , on his train journey from T@@ iti@@ see @-@ Neu@@ stadt to Freiburg , he experienced first @-@ hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport .
&quot; you must continue to be ten@@ acious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better , &quot; he explained in the address given to the local politicians in attendance .
music makes for an enter@@ taining afternoon
it was 15 years ago that the Kau@@ l family first invited the Di@@ et@@ ingen senior citizens for coffee and cake , followed by a snack .
previously , the elderly citizens were hosted in the service station can@@ teen .
the coffee afternoon is now held in the St. Josef nur@@ sing home .
the residents of the home were delighted with the delicious c@@ akes and tar@@ ts .
later on , a s@@ aus@@ age sal@@ ad was provided .
Sil@@ via k@@ im@@ mich @-@ B@@ ant@@ le and her father Karl k@@ im@@ mich enter@@ tained those in attendance with popular tun@@ es .
the more than 100 @-@ year @-@ old natural stone wall , serving as the foremost bound@@ ary between the old school yard - which is due to be renovated - and Kir@@ ch@@ strasse , will once again feature on the renovation cost plan for the town of B@@ rÃ¤@@ un@@ lingen .
in the days before the Kil@@ big Aut@@ umn Fol@@ k Festival , when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard , a small corner wall with bal@@ u@@ stra@@ des was installed to stabili@@ se and relie@@ ve the static load on the old natural stone wall , which is more than one hundred years old .
according to Alexander Mis@@ ok of the B@@ rÃ¤@@ un@@ lingen Muni@@ cip@@ al Plan@@ ning and Building Control Authority , the ongoing procedure plans to involve the Regional Mem@@ orial Authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall .
a cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals , which will then be submitted to the Town Council , which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure .
a decision is expected to be made in the coming year .
following the renovation , pla@@ stering and plan@@ ting of trees in the old internal school yard , within the two w@@ ings of the 19@@ 12 school , as a subsequent measure the bound@@ ary wall , which is in need of refur@@ bish@@ ment , must be renovated from the ground up within the foreseeable future .
the historic , one hundred @-@ year @-@ old bound@@ ary wall between the old school @-@ yard and Kir@@ ch@@ strasse is in need of renovation , primarily as a result of water and fro@@ st damage , on account of the lack of dra@@ in@@ age , and is le@@ aning for@@ wards .
deep cra@@ cks in a number of individual stones testi@@ fy to the weather damage , however , at present the wall is not in danger of collapse .
a secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils , and this is the purpose of the current forti@@ fication work .
the school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008 / 2009 , however , high un@@ planned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back .
the Regional Mem@@ orial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation , which has even been used for fil@@ ming .
if this authority were to impose requirements , then the town of B@@ rÃ¤@@ un@@ lingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument pre@@ serv@@ ation@@ ists .
the pupils of the B@@ rÃ¤@@ un@@ lingen Prim@@ ary School , who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building , with a new hall , will soon be able to use the old school yard as well .
Ã@@ z@@ de@@ mir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
C@@ em Ã@@ z@@ de@@ mir , Federal Chairman of the Green Party , has now engaged in the ongoing discussions regarding the future of the Baden @-@ Wu@@ er@@ ttember@@ g Music Academy .
&quot; I do not think it is right to abandon comprehensive training in the Stuttgart Music College , &quot; said Ã@@ z@@ de@@ mir , speaking to the &quot; Stutt@@ gar@@ ter Nach@@ ri@@ chten . &quot;
jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location of Stuttgart .
as such , Ã@@ z@@ de@@ mir , who is the favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the parliamentary elections on 22 September , is in dis@@ agreement with the Green @-@ Red State Government .
on the basis of an expert study , this government is ur@@ ging the re@@ organisation of the five music col@@ leg@@ es in Baden @-@ Wu@@ er@@ ttember@@ g .
in accordance with these plans , the jazz and pop courses , among others , are to be re@@ located from the Stuttgart Music College to the Mannheim Music College .
us borders : &quot; super tunnel &quot; for drug smu@@ ggling discovered
on the border between Mexico and the USA , investig@@ ators have discovered and shut down a &quot; super tunnel &quot; intended for drug smu@@ ggling .
as announced by the US Customs Auth@@ orities , the pipe between Ti@@ ju@@ ana and San Die@@ go , measuring more than 500 metres in length , was equipped with electricity , a railway track and a ven@@ tilation system .
three susp@@ ects were de@@ tained in relation to the discovery , with eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 ki@@ lo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine sei@@ zed .
according to the details provided , the tunnel had not yet been put into use .
&quot; these car@@ tels are stu@@ pid if they think that they can dig through under the ra@@ dar , &quot; said the US Att@@ or@@ ney for the District of Southern California , Lau@@ ra Di@@ ff@@ y , at a press conference held in front of a ware@@ house in San Die@@ go , where the end of the tunnel was discovered .
referring to the drug gangs , Du@@ ff@@ y assured : &quot; if you continue to build and attempt to use these tun@@ nels , we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money . &quot;
both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug car@@ tels .
since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in Mexico .
built by experts
due to the elabor@@ ate configuration of the tunnel , investig@@ ators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year .
the railway system was equipped in such a way that electri@@ cally powered car@@ ts could be used on it .
on the Mexican side , the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel .
the tunnel has a cross @-@ section measuring 1.@@ 20 metres high and 90 cen@@ timet@@ res across .
it would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the USA .
two of the susp@@ ects were de@@ tained in conjunction with the co@@ ca@@ ine find .
the third , a Mexican , was de@@ tained due to the sei@@ z@@ ure of the mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three face a maximum penalty of life im@@ prison@@ ment , according to the authorities .
since 2006 , eight tun@@ nels of this type have been discovered , the press conference in San Die@@ go continued .
however , this was the first time that co@@ ca@@ ine was found in such a tunnel construction .
normally co@@ ca@@ ine is smu@@ gg@@ led in smaller quantities and not through tun@@ nels .
this shows the &quot; desper@@ ation &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sher@@ man of the D@@ EA Dru@@ g Squ@@ ad in San Die@@ go .
they will do anything to make it to the USA .
no specific details were given regarding those de@@ tained , but it is reported that at least one is Mexican
they can expect prison terms of up to ten years .
2014 is to be a year of celebration in Geis@@ ingen
the anniversary celebrations in the town of Geis@@ ingen , to mark the 1,@@ 25@@ 0@@ th
anniversary of the first documented mention of the town , are drawing closer .
when the year comes to an end in just eight weeks , the anniversary year will be upon us .
Geis@@ ingen and Kir@@ chen @-@ Hau@@ sen were first documented together in the year 7@@ 94 .
a de@@ ed was drafted in Kir@@ chen , in which both towns are mentioned .
on 15 March , the anniversary year will be officially launched , and because Geis@@ ingen currently has no suitable venues , this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,@@ 250 years ago , in Kir@@ chen @-@ Hau@@ sen .
as part of the anniversary celebrations , a number of events are planned both in Geis@@ ingen and Kir@@ chen @-@ Hau@@ sen .
Kir@@ chen @-@ Hau@@ sen will celebrate the 1,@@ 25@@ 0@@ th anniversary with a celeb@@ r@@ atory weekend from 18 to 20
July .
on the Friday there will be a ceremony , and on the Saturday and Sunday a party will be held at the Kir@@ cht@@ al@@ halle .
the Kir@@ chen @-@ Hau@@ sen Kir@@ chen@@ fest festival will also be held on this celeb@@ r@@ atory weekend .
town Musi@@ cal Director , Rudol@@ f Bar@@ th , has composed a commissioned piece for the town on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .
on 21 June , in conjunction with the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ verein &#91; Black Forest Association &#93; M@@ id @-@ Summer Festival , on 12 July in the Arena , accompanied by fire@@ works , and on 13 December as the first concert put on by the Stadt@@ musik ( Town Musi@@ cal Society ) in the new Festival Hall .
this venue will be completed and inau@@ gur@@ ated in the anniversary year , with the official date set for the last weekend in September , on 27 and 28 September .
on the occasion of the Geis@@ ingen town anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le will also be published .
&quot; however , it will not merely be a chron@@ ic@@ le of Geis@@ ingen itself , but rather a printed work on the Geis@@ ingen of today , which now consists of Geis@@ ingen , Kir@@ chen @-@ Hau@@ sen , Leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen , A@@ ul@@ fin@@ gen and Gut@@ ma@@ d@@ ingen , &quot; said Mayor Walter H@@ eng@@ st@@ ler .
and the Geis@@ ingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014 , as it was in 1974 that the incorpor@@ ations to form the current region were completed .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival Hall in Geis@@ ingen .
however , 2014 is also a year of many anni@@ vers@@ aries in other respects .
the Nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft Stro@@ h@@ g@@ lon@@ ki ( Stro@@ h@@ g@@ lon@@ ki F@@ ool &apos;s Guil@@ d celebration ) begins on 8 February with an evening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 60 @-@ year anniversary / The Harmon@@ ie Gut@@ ma@@ d@@ ingen music association will turn 90 years old and on 29 March will hold a celeb@@ r@@ atory ban@@ quet and then from 1 to 4 May will be celebrating the Be@@ zir@@ ks@@ fest &#91; District Music Festival &#93; .
the Leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen N@@ ur@@ sing Home will turn 40 years old , the Geis@@ ingen School has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebrating this on 10 May , and the Poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia Leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celebrating this as part of the Brun@@ nen@@ fest &#91; Fo@@ un@@ tain Festival &#93; from 4 to 7 July .
the town of Geis@@ ingen was first officially documented in the year 7@@ 64 , in a de@@ ed of donation , which is now in the possession of the St. G@@ allen Mon@@ astery .
the de@@ ed was drawn up in Kir@@ chen ( Hau@@ sen ) , which at the time was the location of the cour@@ thouse .
both communities are thus mentioned in the same de@@ ed .
one reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,@@ 250 @-@ year anniversary in this way , is that it also coinci@@ des with the 40@@ th anniversary of the Community Reform ( Gem@@ ein@@ der@@ e@@ form ) .
Council sets its sights on rail system
should the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing be re@@ constructed at great cost , in order to increase traffic safety ?
the Town Coun@@ cils have decided that the answer is yes .
Schil@@ ta@@ ch will have to contribute up to EUR 2@@ 20@@ ,000 to the project .
the Deutsche Bahn hopes to improve the Kin@@ zi@@ gt@@ al railway line in the coming year .
in particular , safety at railway cros@@ sings is to be increased - col@@ li@@ sions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country .
if the municip@@ alities agree to the reconstruction measures , they will be required to contribute one third of the costs , with the remain@@ der divided between Deutsche Bahn and the Federal Government .
Schil@@ ta@@ ch &apos;s town master mas@@ on , Rol@@ and Grie@@ Ã@@ haber , explained the peculi@@ arities of the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing to the Town Council .
at the crossing , the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line .
larger vehicles , for example those that transport long logs , would be able to wait there in the event of on@@ coming traffic , without having to block the railway line .
Grie@@ Ã@@ haber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course wi@@ den the ad@@ joining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic .
this was the subject of controversial discussion in the Town Council , as some council members cast doubt over the need to wi@@ den the road : Thomas Ki@@ pp sum@@ mar@@ ised the perspective of the critics with this statement : &quot; do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles ? &quot;
Mayor Thomas Ha@@ as re@@ tor@@ ted : the &quot; Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs .
even wood from the &quot; Ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; area is occasionally transported via this route , as the vehicles , which measure 20 metres in length , would not be able to use the route via the HÃ¤@@ ber@@ les Bridge , as they would not be able to make the turn on the Haupt@@ strasse .
furthermore , when the Haupt@@ strasse is blocked , the route would also serve as a b@@ yp@@ ass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel , argued Ha@@ as .
given that it is likely that the Kir@@ ch@@ berg and Sch@@ loss@@ berg tunnel will have to be re@@ constructed and renovated , as is currently the case in Wol@@ fach , the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time .
the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned wi@@ dening of the road would inc@@ ur .
nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was con@@ s@@ ented to by a majority , on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could , if required , extend the connecting road in the &quot; Bahn@@ hof@@ straÃe &quot; direction to around 5.@@ 5 metres to accommodate on@@ coming traffic .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trau@@ t@@ wein t@@ ann@@ ery could , on the other hand , bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep &quot; Ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ hÃ¤user Weg . &quot;
the Administ@@ rative Department had Deutsche Bahn &apos;s reconstruction plans investigated by the Bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er Engineering Office , as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ hÃ¤user Weg will be straightforward .
the investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inc@@ lin@@ ation of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck .
the town , as the authority responsible for road construction , would then bear responsibility for this .
the reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes .
because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are , the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be con@@ s@@ ented to , argued Ha@@ as .
at this point , the risk of a train col@@ li@@ sion with a vehicle positioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway cros@@ sings , on account of the fact that there is a mid@@ point from which there is a good line of sight , directly alongside the stopping point .
the trains themselves , coming from the central station , must also be sufficiently slo@@ wed down so that there is no threat of col@@ li@@ sion .
according to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors , the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority , as the town of Schil@@ ta@@ ch would &quot; bear the br@@ unt of the cost &quot; for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck , since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work .
the committee considers the reconstruction of the &quot; V@@ or Heu@@ bach &quot; and &apos; V@@ or Ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; railway cros@@ sings , for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bahn , to be un@@ problematic .
ESA makes decision on major space missions : missions co@@ sting billions
distant plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years .
there were 30 proposals to choose from , five of which are still in the running .
distant worlds .
astronom@@ ers have already found more than 1,000 plan@@ ets near other stars .
whether or not life exists on at least some of these , no @-@ one knows .
the choice is a difficult one : should we search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmo@@ s ?
or search for plan@@ ets similar to the Earth and thus perhaps discover ex@@ tr@@ at@@ erre@@ stri@@ al life ?
these are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency , ESA .
for their &quot; Co@@ s@@ mic Vision &quot; programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which should greatly advance research .
the budget for &quot; L @-@ Mis@@ sions &quot; such as this lies at around one billion Euro .
the projects are planned to start in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
at the beginning of September , the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were up for debate , of which five have now made it onto the short list .
numerous panels are assessing the proposals , posing questions to the researchers .
over the coming days , a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee .
in total , four main questions were chosen by the ESA , to which the missions of the &quot; Co@@ s@@ mic Vision &quot; programme , initiated in 2007 , are to find the answers .
what are the conditions required for the formation of plan@@ ets and life ?
the precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clou@@ ds - and thus the formation of the plan@@ ets that or@@ bit these stars - lie in pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dar@@ k@@ ness .
a large inf@@ ra @-@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could penet@@ rate this dar@@ k@@ ness .
and if a star has plan@@ ets , under what circumstances can life exist there ?
in order to pursue this question , the &quot; Che@@ ops &quot; space tel@@ es@@ cope is to be launched in 20@@ 17 , with which 500 known plan@@ etary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail .
the possibilities are , however , limited - Che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro .
with larger instruments , astronom@@ ers could map plan@@ ets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmosp@@ heres , and thus search for &quot; biom@@ ark@@ ers &quot; : gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity .
how does the solar system function ?
this question should also provide information regarding the pre@@ conditions for the origins of life .
the magnetic activity of a star , the interaction of its magnetic field and the emit@@ ted partic@@ le radiation play an important role .
it is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system , to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere .
with the &quot; Solar Or@@ bit@@ er , &quot; the ESA has already approved an M @-@ class mission ( for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro ) to address this matter .
the probe is to be launched in 20@@ 17 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .
J@@ up@@ iter and its mo@@ ons are also of great interest to the researchers .
they want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .
the ESA is planning that the first of the total of three L @-@ Mis@@ sions of the &quot; Co@@ s@@ mic Vision &quot; programme will address this subject .
the &quot; Ju@@ ice &quot; ( J@@ up@@ iter I@@ cy Mo@@ ons Explorer ) probe is planned to begin its journey in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later it will reach J@@ up@@ iter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ic@@ y mo@@ ons Europa , Cal@@ list@@ o and G@@ any@@ me@@ de .
what are the basic physical laws of the Univer@@ se ?
outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature , as known to us , are still valid there .
there may also be devi@@ ations that could show physi@@ cians the path to a new theory , under the umbrel@@ la of which all known natural laws could be united .
how did the universe come about and what does it consist of ?
13.@@ 7 billion years ago , our cosmo@@ s was created by the Big B@@ ang .
alongside the materials familiar to us , from which stars , plan@@ ets and life forms such as ourselves are composed , there exists dark matter , the gra@@ vit@@ ational force of which holds galax@@ ies and galax@@ y clu@@ sters together , and dark energy , the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe .
thus far , researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big B@@ ang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .
with &quot; Eu@@ cli@@ d , &quot; the ESA has already approved an M @-@ mission , planned to comm@@ ence in 2020 .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope , the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy .
proposals that are in the running ...
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .
the proposal with the best chance of approval as an L @-@ mission , in the opinion of many experts , is &quot; E @-@ Lis@@ a , &quot; a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
many physi@@ cians perc@@ ei@@ ve this to ent@@ ail changes in the structure of space @-@ time , which Albert Ein@@ stein predi@@ cted almost 100 years ago .
to date they have never been proved to exist .
the scientists behind the project hope that Eli@@ sa could achieve this .
the mission involves placing a dete@@ ctor , consisting of two or three prob@@ es , in outer space .
unlike systems on Earth , it could also prove gra@@ vit@@ ational waves created during the Big B@@ ang , and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmo@@ s .
four other proposals are still competing for the second L @-@ mission place : a large X @-@ ray tel@@ es@@ cope called &quot; Ath@@ ena , &quot; which among other things would research black holes , &quot; I@@ cy Plan@@ ets , &quot; another mission to the outer plan@@ ets of the solar system , &quot; pr@@ ism , &quot; a mission for the measurement of cos@@ mic background radiation , and the &quot; Ex@@ op@@ lan@@ et Fin@@ der , &quot; which would find and investigate plan@@ ets similar to Earth .
among others , proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from Mars , conducting research on the moon , Ven@@ us and ast@@ ero@@ ids , as well as proposals in the area of solar physi@@ cs .
Snow@@ den ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snow@@ den , the US intelligence whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director K@@ eit@@ h Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
German MP Hans @-@ Christian Str@@ Ã¶@@ bel@@ e on Thursday met Mr Snow@@ den in Russia , where he has been granted asylum , to discuss him testi@@ fying in Germany .
a letter from Mr Snow@@ den , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP , said : &quot; though the outcome of my efforts has been demon@@ stra@@ bly positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ec@@ tion , and seeks to crimin@@ alise political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence . &quot;
however , speaking the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , Mr Snow@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him .
the charges filed by the US justice department include es@@ pion@@ age and the@@ ft of government property .
Hans @-@ Peter Friedrich , German interior minister , told Zeit Online : &quot; if Mr Snow@@ den is ready to speak to German officials , we will find ways to make this possible . &quot;
relations between the US and Germany have come under stra@@ in following claims that the N@@ SA bu@@ gged Chancellor Angela &apos;s Merkel &apos;s phone .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that over@@ sees intelligence , said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snow@@ den as a witness &quot; without bringing him into danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the US , &quot; it should be taken .
Mr Str@@ Ã¶@@ bel@@ e , an MP for Germany &apos;s Green party , published a picture of himself with Mr Snow@@ den on his Twitter feed .
he was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists .
Mr Str@@ Ã¶@@ bel@@ e said that , according to the former N@@ SA contra@@ ctor &apos;s lawyer , Mr Snow@@ den would not be able to return to Russia if he left .
if Mr Snow@@ den testi@@ fied in Germany he would need ass@@ ur@@ ances that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there , the MP said .
Mr Snow@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a &quot; severe and sustained &quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home .
however he said that he was hear@@ tened by the worldwide response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of per@@ va@@ sive surveillance to be a public service .
the letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
frontier Airlines to charge for carry @-@ on baggage
frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to store carry @-@ on luggage on board their flight .
frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a carry @-@ on bag and $ 2 for coffee or so@@ da , although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
the new carry @-@ on fee is for bags in the over@@ head bin , so small bags under the seat will still be free .
frontier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if travelers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate .
frontier spo@@ kes@@ woman K@@ ate O &apos;@@ M@@ alley said the $ 100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to charge that , &quot; she said .
airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stu@@ ff@@ ing as much as they can into carry @-@ on baggage st@@ ash@@ ed in over@@ head b@@ ins , meaning those b@@ ins often run out of space .
fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board .
o &apos;@@ M@@ alley said the new charge is not really about raising money .
it &apos;s about Fron@@ tier &apos;s most loyal customers making it very clear that finding over@@ head bin space has become increasingly difficult .
passengers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay .
that means one passenger in line at a Fron@@ tier gate might get to bring a bag on for free , while the next person in line might owe $ 100 for a similar bag .
o &apos;@@ M@@ alley said Fron@@ tier &apos;s website and check @-@ in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate .
frontier &apos;s new carry @-@ on fee won &apos;t start until summer , though a date has@@ n &apos;t been set .
passengers often g@@ rum@@ ble about baggage charges and other fees , but airlines love them .
they argue that luggage costs money to handle , and passengers who want the service should pay for it .
many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most haven &apos;t touched carry @-@ on bag fees , though .
spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry @-@ on fee three years ago , and fellow dis@@ counter Al@@ legi@@ ant Air later followed .
the only other airline with such a fee is Hungary &apos;s Wiz@@ z Air , said airline consul@@ tant J@@ ay Sor@@ en@@ sen , who closely tracks add @-@ on fees .
he estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit &apos;s carry @-@ on fee brings in $ 50 million a year .
Sor@@ en@@ sen , a former executive with Mid@@ west Airlines , fle@@ w Spirit recently and wonder@@ ed what he &apos;d find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit &apos;s unusual carry @-@ on bag fee .
&quot; the boarding process was the smooth@@ est I had seen in my airline career , &quot; he said .
I was expecting to see gn@@ ash@@ ing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate .
the plane was full , he said , &quot; and it bo@@ arded li@@ ck@@ ety @-@ split . &quot;
frontier is also following Spirit &apos;s $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , so@@ da , or juice .
frontier said passengers who get so@@ da or juice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee re@@ fil@@ ls for free .
it will still give away water .
us Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers compla@@ ined and no other major airline followed .
frontier &apos;s move to charge the carry @-@ on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to ste@@ er customers toward its own website .
airlines pay online travel s@@ ellers such as Or@@ bit@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
that has given all airlines an incentive to ste@@ er passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency .
frontier has gone the fur@@ th@@ est in this area , though .
in September it began giving half as many frequent fli@@ er miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .
on Wednesday it s@@ las@@ hed the mile@@ age award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip .
so , a 1,000 mile Fron@@ tier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
it also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Fron@@ tier website .
frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Den@@ ver , but its business is shr@@ in@@ king and losing money .
revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shr@@ ank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Hol@@ dings Inc .
Republic has been trying to fix Fron@@ tier &apos;s finances as part of selling the airline .
sa@@ y@@ ings come from the Bi@@ ble
at least 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast of the year , in the Evange@@ li@@ cal Par@@ ish of Bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the parish hall was &quot; Sa@@ y@@ ings from the Bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; Ex@@ pres@@ sions from the Middle Ages . &quot;
Z@@ ita K@@ Ã¶h@@ ler , the Chair@@ person of the Par@@ ish Council , agreed to give a talk on Bi@@ bli@@ cal pro@@ verb@@ s after breakfast .
&quot; pro@@ verb@@ s contain pe@@ ar@@ ls of wisdom , comm@@ and@@ ments or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several German sa@@ y@@ ings with the corresponding Bi@@ ble ver@@ ses and explained the meaning .
she referred to sa@@ y@@ ings such as : &quot; Holz@@ au@@ ge sei wach@@ sam &quot; ( keep your eyes pe@@ eled ) , &quot; wie Schu@@ ppen von den Au@@ gen fallen &quot; ( like sc@@ ales falling from one &apos;s eyes ) , &quot; ein Au@@ ge auf jem@@ and wer@@ fen &quot; ( to cast an eye on someone ) , &quot; den S@@ einen gibt &apos;s der Herr im Schla@@ f &quot; ( good things come to some when they sleep ) and &quot; seine H@@ Ã¤n@@ de in Un@@ sch@@ ul@@ d wa@@ schen &quot; ( to wash one &apos;s hands of something ) .
on several occasions , the speaker asked those listening to gu@@ ess what pro@@ ver@@ b they were based on .
expressions from the Middle Ages were addressed by Par@@ ish Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Christ@@ el D@@ eh@@ ner : &quot; aller guten D@@ inge sind drei &quot; ( All good things come in thre@@ es ) , &quot; bla@@ u machen &quot; ( to ski@@ p school / work ) , &quot; etwas ver@@ hau@@ en &quot; ( to wal@@ lo@@ p something ) .
she explained the meaning and origin of the expressions , which she referred to as &quot; bridges to the past . &quot;
to round off the morning there was a tom@@ b@@ ola .
the prizes were placed , covered , on a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously par@@ aph@@ ra@@ sed prior to being presented to the winners .
may@@ oral candidate Roman W@@ ai@@ zen@@ eg@@ ger was also to be found among the visitors to the joint breakfast .
learning rather than unemployment : tourism pilot project for the un@@ trained
a pilot project for the tourist industry is being launched today in the Me@@ ck@@ len@@ burg lake district .
under the management of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 men and women who are already working within the industry as un@@ trained workers , will be trained as qualified hotel and restaurant staff over the course of three w@@ inters .
&quot; what &apos;s innovative about it is that the six @-@ month courses end with diplom@@ as , &quot; said Carmen Wie@@ ch@@ ert of the Neu@@ brand@@ enburg Employment Agency .
there are many benefits : the participants will not be unemployed , the companies receive trained skilled workers , which are in continually increasing demand in hotels and restaurants , and the agency will not have to fund unemployment .
also involved in the project are the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Deutsche Hotel@@ - und Gast@@ stÃ¤@@ tte , DE@@ HO@@ GA ) of Me@@ ck@@ len@@ burg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
N@@ SA bl@@ ames &quot; Internal Er@@ ror , &quot; Not Hack@@ ers , For Website Cra@@ sh
the sha@@ dow@@ y National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a gli@@ t@@ ch that brought down its public website for a few hours , not h@@ ack@@ ers as some claimed online .
&quot; N@@ S@@ A.@@ go@@ v was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; the sp@@ y agency said in an em@@ ailed statement .
the issue will be resolved this evening .
claims that the ou@@ tage was caused by a distributed deni@@ al of service &#91; D@@ Do@@ S &#93; attack are not true .
earlier this evening online server tra@@ ckers noted the N@@ SA &apos;s website had been down for at least six hours , and the site continues to be in@@ accessible for some users .
earlier an N@@ SA spo@@ kes@@ person told AB@@ C News the agency &apos;s internal , sensitive network was &quot; not at all &quot; com@@ promised .
no classified information is in danger , the spo@@ kes@@ person said .
at least one h@@ ack@@ tiv@@ ist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the N@@ SA site with a D@@ Do@@ S attack .
D@@ Do@@ S attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
the cy@@ ber tac@@ tic is a relatively uns@@ oph@@ istic@@ ated one and the attacks are not meant to penet@@ rate the internal network of the target system .
the formerly super secre@@ tive N@@ SA , once nick@@ named No Su@@ ch Agency , has found itself in very public light , and am@@ id vi@@ cious criticism , in past months following a stream of revel@@ ations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret N@@ SA files stol@@ en from the agency and le@@ aked by di@@ sen@@ chan@@ ted former N@@ SA contra@@ ctor Edward Snow@@ den .
such growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the agency promp@@ ted early speculation that tonight &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
in October , the number of j@@ ob@@ less fell slightly by 22 , to a total of 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
the rate of 3.1 per cent is indeed better than the previous year and is also better than in September , &quot; however , we had hoped for more , &quot; said Mon@@ ika Fel@@ der @-@ Bauer , acting branch manager of the Employment Agency in Son@@ tho@@ fen .
several companies have thus far re@@ acted cau@@ ti@@ ously when it comes to hi@@ ring .
stating a reason for this , Fel@@ der @-@ Bauer said : &quot; we have barely any skilled workers in the fields of skilled crafts and tra@@ des , healthcare and geri@@ at@@ ric care . &quot;
seasonal job offers for staff in hotel and restaurant businesses have been coming in since September .
the Winter season within the industry begins in mid @-@ December .

Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er profit di@@ ps as plane deliveries , orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday , pres@@ su@@ red by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit .
Montreal @-@ based Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er also did not release any flight test data for its brand @-@ new C@@ Series aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September .
after the test plane &apos;s inau@@ gu@@ ral flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flo@@ wn three more times , raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track .
results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sli@@ ding more than 8 percent on the Tor@@ onto Stock Exchange .
Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , an analy@@ st with National Bank Financial , lower@@ ed his rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; out@@ perform &quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited up@@ side over the next one or two quarters .
&quot; while the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation , &quot; Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said in a client note .
we believe that Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will receive new orders for the C@@ Series as the flight test program pro@@ gresses .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we suspect that the market will become more skep@@ tical of the program .
Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes the C@@ Series aircraft family can cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ t it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
the first test plane was un@@ vei@@ led in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays .
but firm orders for the C@@ Series are moderate so far at 17@@ 7 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to vali@@ date the company &apos;s claims about the new jet@@ liner &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential .
there are currently 4@@ 03 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators .
chief Executive Officer Pierre Beau@@ do@@ in was confident Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use .
exec@@ u@@ tives also reas@@ su@@ red an@@ alyst@@ s and media on Thursday the program was progres@@ sing according to schedule .
&quot; the test plane didn &apos;t stay on the ground longer than anticipated , &quot; Beau@@ do@@ in said in a conference call , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane &apos;s down@@ time .
every manufacturer sched@@ ules it in a different way .
we had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that &apos;s what we have done .
that will happen all through the flight program .
the second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the remain@@ der following shortly after , the company said .
still , an@@ alyst@@ s are skep@@ tical the first customer can begin operating a C@@ Series plane 12 months after its ma@@ iden flight .
Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er said it was evaluating the entry @-@ into @-@ service ( E@@ IS ) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months .
&quot; this slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s internal schedule apparently - rein@@ forces our view that entry @-@ into @-@ service will be pushed to Q@@ 1 / 15 , &quot; said Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
for the third quarter ended September 30 , Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or 8 c@@ ents per share , from $ 17@@ 2 million , or 9 c@@ ents per share a year earlier .
adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 c@@ ents .
revenue di@@ pped margin@@ ally to $ 4.1 billion from $ 4.@@ 2 billion .
an@@ alyst@@ s had expected earnings of 10 c@@ ents per share and revenue of $ 4.@@ 56 billion , according to Th@@ om@@ son Re@@ u@@ ters I / B / E / S.
the world &apos;s fourth @-@ largest plan@@ em@@ aker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , down from 57 a year earlier .
net orders fell to 26 aircraft , from 83 .
the back@@ log in the aero@@ space division was $ 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion as of September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .
&quot; in aero@@ space , results were in line with our guidance , but the low order in@@ take and overall market conditions were a disappointment , &quot; Beau@@ do@@ in said .
aero@@ space revenue fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world &apos;s largest tra@@ in@@ maker , said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
the order back@@ log in the transportation unit was $ 3@@ 2.6 billion as of September 30 , up margin@@ ally from December 31 .
the transportation division &apos;s mar@@ gins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts .
exec@@ u@@ tives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter .
shares of Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick P@@ ich@@ ette would join the board , were down 8.@@ 5 percent at C $ 4.@@ 83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday .
Brazil &apos;s Emb@@ ra@@ er SA , the world &apos;s third @-@ largest commercial plan@@ em@@ aker and Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s closest rival , reported a 10 percent fall in quar@@ terly profit on Thursday .
USA : shots fi@@ red at Los Angeles Airport
on Friday morning ( local time ) an unknown suspect fi@@ red shots at the LA@@ X Airport .
while the airport management announced via short mess@@ aging service Twitter that the sho@@ oter is in cu@@ sto@@ dy , the &quot; Los Angeles Times &quot; reported that the man is dead .
a member of security staff was also killed .
the media also reported that several people injured .
us President Barack Obama is being kept informed of the situation , said White House spo@@ kes@@ person J@@ ay Car@@ ney .
the incident took place in Terminal 3 . eye wit@@ nesses reported seeing a sho@@ oter with a gun in one of the departure lo@@ ung@@ es , as was reported by several media .
one trav@@ eller told the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N about how many people had sought protection in pan@@ ic .
travellers scre@@ amed and children cri@@ ed .
pan@@ ic broke out among those waiting , with many hi@@ ding behind seats in fear .
an employee of the &quot; Los Angeles Times &quot; who was travelling at the time told of how he had heard two shots fi@@ red .
an employee of security company T@@ SA suffered a gun@@ shot wo@@ und to the foot .

a top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation , because he fe@@ ared his secret drug addi@@ ction would be exposed , has been j@@ ailed for three years .
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed sensitive intelligence to crime l@@ ord N@@ eil S@@ car@@ b@@ rough about in@@ quiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became com@@ promised by his co@@ ca@@ ine hab@@ it .
the so@@ lic@@ it@@ or , who was nick@@ named &quot; Bas@@ h &quot; and ha@@ iled by criminals as a &quot; top brief , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , who he had represented in a previous nar@@ co@@ tics trial .
officers spot@@ ted Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 , drop@@ ping off three bags of co@@ ca@@ ine at the lawyer &apos;s home in Black@@ burn , Lan@@ cas@@ hire , while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues .
in@@ quiries revealed D@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , on his wal@@ let and on his credit cards .
over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illi@@ c@@ itly obtain information on the arre@@ sts of two men on behalf of S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough as well as one of his associ@@ ates .
all four susp@@ ects were being wat@@ ched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a hero@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine ra@@ cket operating across Lan@@ cas@@ hire , Cum@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ k@@ shire and West Yor@@ k@@ shire .
they and 32 other men were later j@@ ailed after police sei@@ zed hero@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth Â£ 1.@@ 5@@ million along with more than Â£ 200@@ ,000 in cash during a series of ra@@ ids .
di@@ tta , 42 , fed information to criminals because of fears his co@@ ca@@ ine addi@@ ction would be exposed
today at Li@@ ver@@ pool Cro@@ wn Court D@@ it@@ ta , who works at law firm For@@ bes So@@ lic@@ it@@ ors , based in Black@@ burn , was facing dis@@ grace after being found guilty of two counts of per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice following a three week trial at Li@@ ver@@ pool Cro@@ wn Court .
he admitted co@@ ca@@ ine possession at an earlier hearing .
the lawyer &apos;s down@@ fall came after police investig@@ ating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with D@@ it@@ ta in February 2011 .
two dete@@ c@@ tives tra@@ iled the suspect and spot@@ ted him arriving at D@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a pur@@ ity of 60 per cent under the lawyer &apos;s b@@ ins in a black golf g@@ love .
soon after the drop off , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was in regular phone contact with D@@ it@@ ta who had been out at the dinner at the Black@@ burn Ro@@ vers football stadium , E@@ wood Park .
the lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them .
the court heard D@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of co@@ ca@@ ine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair , wal@@ let and on his credit cards
di@@ tta was arrested later but denied using co@@ ca@@ ine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privilege . &quot;
during his arrest D@@ it@@ ta picked up his wal@@ let and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all sei@@ zed and a hair sample was taken f@@ om him .
in a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .
but the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain , some of whom he had previously represented , after key arre@@ sts to tell them what dete@@ c@@ tives knew about them .
prosec@@ uting , Anne W@@ hy@@ te said : &quot; if anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or . &quot;
Mr D@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or , having become too involved with specific clients .
the relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs .
some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer .
but this went way beyond the ordinary con@@ fines of a lawyer @-@ client relationship .
he th@@ war@@ ted the police &apos;s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities .
Mr D@@ it@@ ta was not hon@@ ouring his profession , but dish@@ on@@ ouring it .
he got too close to certain clients , in particular S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be com@@ promised .
di@@ tta denied wron@@ g@@ doing and claimed : &quot; if I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and I wanted to feed information to Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not wait 15 hours , I would do it immediately . &quot;
but after the hearing sup@@ t Lee Hal@@ stead from Lan@@ cas@@ hire Police said : &quot; Mr D@@ it@@ ta turned from criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his addi@@ ction to co@@ ca@@ ine left him hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly com@@ promised and vulnerable to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime groups who t@@ asked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations .
so@@ lic@@ it@@ ors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should in@@ stil trust and confidence in the public .
Mr D@@ it@@ ta has betra@@ yed this trust and attempted to hide behind the ven@@ eer of his profession .
Lan@@ cas@@ hire &apos;s Seri@@ ous and Organ@@ ised Cri@@ me Unit led the investigation into Mr D@@ it@@ ta which has also seen him convi@@ cted of three counts of possession of co@@ ca@@ ine and now per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice , demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice .
let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
we will find you and put you before the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was j@@ ailed for 14 years after ple@@ ading guilty to con@@ spi@@ racy to supply hero@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and cann@@ ab@@ is .
thirty five other men involved in the ra@@ cket were j@@ ailed for a total of 15@@ 3 years for drugs offences .
on his website D@@ it@@ ta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fant@@ asy job would be a lawyer representing clients on De@@ ath Ro@@ w in America , his ultimate dinner guest as being Moh@@ amm@@ ed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work .
revolutionary Sac@@ red Music Fac@@ tory
to close the celebrations on the occasion of its 16@@ 0@@ th anniversary , the L@@ ieder@@ kran@@ z Dun@@ n@@ ingen ( Dun@@ n@@ ingen A@@ mat@@ eur Cho@@ ir , or gle@@ e Club , if you like ) will perform Franz Schu@@ bert &apos;s &quot; Deutsche Messe &quot; ( German M@@ ass ) to accompany two church services .
following the great success of the musical , &quot; Rock my Life , &quot; which enth@@ used audi@@ ences this past Spring , the L@@ ieder@@ kran@@ z will b@@ less two church services with the performance of Franz Schu@@ bert &apos;s Deutsche Messe , to close its anniversary year celebrations .
on Saturday 26 October , this exceptional mass will be heard from 7@@ .00 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Mar@@ in@@ us@@ kirche Dun@@ n@@ ingen and on Sunday 27 October , from 10.@@ 15 , at the service in the St. Johannes B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st@@ kirche in L@@ ack@@ endor@@ f .
the so @-@ called &apos; German M@@ ass &apos; , with the original title &quot; Ges@@ Ã¤n@@ ge zur Fei@@ er des hei@@ li@@ ges O@@ pf@@ ers der Messe &quot; ( Songs to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the mass ) , D 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual work by composer Franz Schu@@ bert , dating from 18@@ 26 , at at the time it was written was considered almost revolutionary .
pat@@ ron Joh@@ an Phili@@ pp Ne@@ um@@ ann has in mind for the mass to be performed as part of the church services .
under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Her@@ mann Schnei@@ der , the cho@@ ir will be accompanied by the wind en@@ semble of the Fro@@ h@@ sin@@ n T@@ enn@@ en@@ bron@@ n Music Society , and by No@@ em@@ i Lok@@ o@@ di on the organ .
Has@@ la@@ ch : scep@@ ticism visi@@ bly gives way to confidence
the 2015 Par@@ ish Council elections will bring about fundamental change , for example in the Has@@ la@@ ch Past@@ oral Care Unit ( Seel@@ sor@@ ge@@ ein@@ heit Has@@ la@@ ch , SE ) .
there will then only be one joint Par@@ ish Council for all six par@@ ishes .
in a joint meeting on Saturday , the committees from Has@@ la@@ ch , Hof@@ st@@ etten , M@@ Ã¼h@@ len@@ bach , F@@ is@@ cher@@ bach , Stein@@ ach and Wel@@ sch@@ enst@@ ein@@ ach prepared for the changes .
this is because there are no further changes to be made to the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese and it is up to the Par@@ ish Coun@@ cils to implement these in as satisfactory a manner possible .
during the course of the day one thing became particularly clear : the scep@@ ticism towards the new system is reluct@@ antly yet visi@@ bly giving way to confidence .
the extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full @-@ time members of the past@@ oral care team addressed topics ranging from perc@@ ep@@ tions and expectations regarding the 2015 reforms , to concrete proposals regarding the future composition and size of the Par@@ ish Council .
regional D@@ ean Georg Sch@@ mit@@ t explained the newly drawn @-@ up guidelines for past@@ oral care units in the arch @-@ di@@ oc@@ ese of Freiburg with the help of a presentation .
according to the guidelines , the SE Has@@ la@@ ch , as a church community , will be a corpor@@ ation under public law , which shall assume the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .
there will then only be one joint Par@@ ish Council and a Foundation Council , in which the rec@@ tor will be represented by virtue of his office .
from each parish , at least two elected members are to be represented , with so @-@ called church community teams set up on @-@ site in the six par@@ ishes .
in future their task will be to promote church life on a local basis .
regarding the issue of the finances of the individual par@@ ishes , the need for extensive discussion became evident .
the reforms plan for the accum@@ ulated assets in the par@@ ishes to be retained for a specified purpose .
accounts pay@@ able , on the other hand , will be passed over to the &quot; church community &quot; as a whole .
in particular , planned major investments , the debts from which thus affect all par@@ ishes , were cause for great concern .
&quot; in the past , investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual par@@ ishes by themselves , &quot; said Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s Par@@ ish Council Chairman Brun@@ o Prin@@ z@@ bach .
Bar@@ bar Rit@@ ter , Chair of the Committee in the Sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wald @-@ Neu@@ ried past@@ oral care unit , has practical experience of a joint committee for five par@@ ishes .
in 2006 she set herself the task , &quot; Be@@ come one , remain five &quot; and came to realise that the task is really not that simple .
the Comm@@ it@@ tees of the Has@@ la@@ ch past@@ oral care unit set out to answer questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint Par@@ ish Council , and the practical work of the church community teams .
the specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring .
at the end , Par@@ ish Co@@ uns@@ ell@@ or Michael SchÃ¶n@@ er from Stein@@ ach presented the new logo of the past@@ oral care unit , which was agreed on by a clear majority .
electricity to become more expensive in P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f
the citizens of P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f will have to adjust to high electricity costs .
as Managing Director of the municipal energy company , J@@ Ã¶r@@ g @-@ Ar@@ ne Bi@@ as , confirmed to the S@@ Ã@@ D@@ K@@ UR@@ IER , families of four in P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f will be on the receiving end of a price increase of EUR 70 to 90 per year .
one major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so @-@ called EEC Lev@@ y from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 C@@ ents per ki@@ lo@@ wat@@ t hour .
this lev@@ y will be re@@ set by the four operators of the large power gri@@ ds , in October of each year .
they estimate the additional costs they will inc@@ ur as a result of the &quot; energy turn@@ around , &quot; which they will be able to recover by means of a lev@@ y on the price of electricity .
the P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f municipal energy company forms the last link in this chain .
in its projec@@ tions , the supervisory council of the energy company even assumed a lev@@ y higher than that reported by J@@ Ã¶r@@ g @-@ Ar@@ ne Bi@@ as .
the specific figures must now be calculated before the municipal energy c@@ mp@@ any can inform its customers of the precise price increase next week .
&quot; we are working on the assumption of an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; said Bi@@ as , with the figure likely to be closer to 2 c@@ ents .
traffic lights permanently red : observe waiting time
sometimes a traffic light simply never turns green .
the contact loop on the road does not react , or the light itself is def@@ ec@@ tive .
what should you do - drive through on red ?
if an affected person has wa@@ ited for a sufficiently long period of time at a red light , and provided the crossing is clear , they can drive on , explained Stuttgart @-@ based lawyer R@@ al@@ f Be@@ cker in &quot; Motor@@ rad &quot; ( Motor@@ cycle ) magazine .
the waiting time must , however , be &quot; appropriate , &quot; which can be interpreted differently on a case @-@ to @-@ case basis .
Be@@ cker advis@@ es that you wait at least five minutes before a fault with the traffic lights can be assumed .
anyone who drives on in spite of a red light must , however , be aware that he / she will be fully liable for any resulting accident .
anyone who wa@@ its for less than five minutes has , under certain circumstances , not wa@@ ited long enough , warned Be@@ cker , referring to a ruling of the Ham@@ m High@@ er Regional Court .
in the case in question , a driver ignored a light that was permanently red after around three minutes and and was held responsible for negli@@ gently jum@@ ping a red light .
the traffic lights were actually not def@@ ec@@ tive , but rather turned green just a few minutes later .
he was sp@@ ared a driving ban on account of the special circumstances - but was not sp@@ ared a fine .
town Council delighted with solid budget
every time discussion in Town Council meetings turns to the budget , Mayor R@@ al@@ ph Ger@@ ster has good reason to smile .
the municipality coff@@ ers in Her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen @-@ SchÃ¶n@@ ach are well sto@@ cked and the administration has been debt @-@ free since 2005 .
in this sense , this the 2012 budgetary year , can also be recorded as a complete success .
this became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as Andrea Roth@@ mund explained , the administrative budget came in at more than EUR one million higher than originally planned , at around 7.@@ 6 million Euro .
the administrative budget surplus , at around EUR 1.@@ 8 million , also stood at around EUR one million above projec@@ tions .
the surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities &apos; contribution towards income tax .
the capital budget also stood well above the projec@@ ted values .
instead of the projec@@ ted EUR 1.5 million Euro , the value for last year was EUR 2.5 million .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget , &quot; said Roth@@ mund .
because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned , the reserves also came in higher .
in total , they managed to increase the general contin@@ gency reserves by around EUR 2.1 million , to a total of EUR 4.@@ 9 million .
Mayor R@@ al@@ ph Ger@@ ster than@@ ked Roth@@ mund and its team for the good work .
&quot; a job like this is not something you achieve overnight , &quot; said Ger@@ ster in praise of the annual financial statement .
he and the Town Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors are clearly delighted with the good figures .
it may sound like a par@@ adox , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens .
in the past , a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates .
however , according to Ger@@ ster , from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state .
there are prerequ@@ is@@ ites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements .
among other requirements , the towns and municip@@ alities applying for the subsidies must lev@@ y certain municipal rates .
&quot; we have to address the subject of municipal rates , as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies , &quot; comm@@ ented Ger@@ ster regarding this matter .
Nag@@ old : Hu@@ go Wer@@ m@@ ter - a cho@@ ir member for 60 years
having been a singer for 60 years , Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter &apos;s story with the C@@ Ã¤@@ ci@@ lia Male Ch@@ oral Society is almost twice as long as that of the Aut@@ umn Festival , during which he was cerem@@ oni@@ ally hon@@ oured .
as per usual , Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter stood on the stage in the colours of his male voice cho@@ ir .
even after 60 years he still finds great pleasure from singing with the cho@@ ir , which has achieved much more than popularity during this period .
Wer@@ m@@ ter has also been active within the association , serving as a member of the committee for 28 years , among other roles .
for his commitment and loyalty to the organisation , he has also received several awards : J@@ Ã¶r@@ g Koh@@ r , La@@ y Past@@ or acting on behalf of the C@@ Ã¤@@ ci@@ lian Association of Rot@@ ten@@ burg @-@ Stuttgart , presented him with an Association Certi@@ fic@@ ate and a letter of comm@@ end@@ ation signed by Bis@@ hop Geb@@ hard FÃ¼r@@ st - the cho@@ ir also serves as a church cho@@ ir .
his cho@@ ir colleagues presented him with a German Ch@@ oral Association certificate and an en@@ gra@@ ved pe@@ w@@ ter plate .
aside from hon@@ ouring Hu@@ go , the 3@@ 1st Aut@@ umn Festival progres@@ sed as usual : alongside the Bet@@ ra Male Voice Cho@@ ir , the Salz@@ st@@ etten Ch@@ oral Club , the Ba@@ is@@ ingen Ch@@ oral Division and the Lo@@ cal Music Society , the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen sin@@ gers delivered a colourful blend of different ch@@ oral and song styles , which enter@@ tained the 400 or so visitors .
the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen Male Voice Cho@@ ir got things running with atmosp@@ h@@ eric songs such as &quot; Im Wein@@ para@@ dies &quot; and &quot; L@@ us@@ tig , ihr BrÃ¼@@ der . &quot;
they had also prepared a short ser@@ en@@ ade as a tribute to their hon@@ or@@ ary singer Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter - Wolfgang Ama@@ de@@ us Mozart &apos;s &quot; Bundes@@ lied . &quot;
the Bet@@ ra Male Voice Cho@@ ir also s@@ ang classic ch@@ oral pieces such as &quot; JÃ¤@@ ger@@ wer@@ ben &quot; by Juli@@ us W@@ eng@@ ert , &quot; weit , weit weg &quot; by Hu@@ bert Go@@ is@@ ern and the folk song &quot; Wan@@ n du durch@@ geh@@ st durch@@ s Tal . &quot;
with its mixed cho@@ ir and its ladies &apos; en@@ semble - the &quot; Imp@@ ul@@ sch@@ or &quot; ( Impulse Cho@@ ir ) , the Salz@@ st@@ etten Ch@@ oral Club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival .
the mixed cho@@ ir carried listen@@ ers away to foreign lands with the Ne@@ a@@ politan fol@@ k@@ songs &quot; Santa Lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; E@@ vi@@ va Esp@@ ana &quot; by An@@ tos G@@ us , while the &quot; Imp@@ ul@@ sch@@ or &quot; also drew on foreign languages : &quot; Liber@@ ati@@ o &quot; and &quot; H@@ ey Ju@@ de &quot; were included on their programme .
the Ch@@ oral Division of the Ba@@ is@@ ingen Sports Club returned to its home ground with &quot; Was I@@ sch der Schw@@ ob ? &quot; by Hans SÃ¼@@ s@@ sm@@ uth and Robert Pap@@ per@@ t &apos;s &quot; Bier@@ lied , &quot; while the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen Music Society provided the crow@@ ning musical conclusion .
for children , there was a small au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary programme - &quot; O@@ ma Han@@ ne &quot; ( Gr@@ and@@ ma Han@@ ne ) , a.@@ k@@ .@@ a H@@ ann@@ el@@ ore St@@ oll@@ stei@@ mer , performed a &apos; Kas@@ per@@ l &apos; theater ( similar to P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy ) and read some stories , which kept the children enter@@ tained throughout the afternoon .
children &apos;s dreams come true
over the next few days , the nur@@ ser@@ y schools and day care centres in Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b district will be receiving mail .
the Schwar@@ zw@@ Ã¤l@@ der B@@ ote ( Black Forest Her@@ ald ) , in collaboration with Bau@@ haus and the Spar@@ k@@ asse Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b Sav@@ ings Bank , would like to support the institutions in granting their construction and renovation wishes .
does the nur@@ ser@@ y school need a new sand box ?
all nur@@ series , day care centres and cr@@ Ã©@@ ches from across the entire Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b district can become involved in the campaign .
if they have a construction or renovation request for their institution , they can register this with the Schwar@@ zw@@ Ã¤l@@ der B@@ ote .
get creative with your children and surprise the jud@@ ging panel of the Kinder@@ garten @-@ Bau@@ stelle ( N@@ ur@@ ser@@ y School @-@ Con@@ struction Site ) campaign .
a panel consisting of representatives from the Schwar@@ zw@@ Ã¤l@@ der B@@ ote , Bau@@ haus and Spar@@ k@@ asse Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b will select three wishes from those submitted .

Ken@@ yan press ou@@ tra@@ ged at controversial media law
&quot; it is a fri@@ gh@@ tening place , and it is valid to ask : what is there to prevent Parliament from simply swe@@ eping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? &quot; the paper said , challenging the bill as un@@ constitutional .
&quot; this law is dra@@ con@@ ian and very p@@ uni@@ tive and we reject it , &quot; said Cy@@ rus Kam@@ au , managing director for Capital Group - home to Cap@@ ital@@ FM , one of Kenya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
he said the new media tri@@ bunal &quot; will always be bi@@ ased because it &apos;s an extension of the government , &quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&quot; I hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MP@@ s , &quot; he said .
according to The Star newspaper , the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot; a stran@@ gle@@ hold over the media , &quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot; dealt a major blow &quot; and lam@@ ba@@ sted the bill as &quot; dra@@ con@@ ian . &quot;
the passing of the bill comes am@@ id a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September &apos;s attack by Islam@@ ist gun@@ men on the West@@ gate shopping m@@ all .
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera foot@@ age of troops who were dispat@@ ched to the scene of the attack pur@@ porte@@ dly rob@@ bing the up@@ market m@@ all .
police chief David K@@ ima@@ i@@ yo re@@ acted by sum@@ mon@@ ing two journalists and a media executive for ques@@ tioning , although the sum@@ mon@@ s was re@@ tra@@ cted following a media out@@ c@@ ry .
under the new bill , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Ken@@ yan shi@@ ll@@ ings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot; de @-@ listed , &quot; or bar@@ red from receiving official press ac@@ credi@@ tation .
the tri@@ bunal also has the power to sei@@ ze the property of an off@@ ender if a fine is not paid .
according to the D@@ ai@@ ly Nation , &quot; even one fine is enough to cri@@ pp@@ le most FM stations . &quot;
it also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; lively blo@@ go@@ sphere . &quot;
by si@@ len@@ cing the media , politicians know they can do whatever they like with imp@@ unity .
&quot; no one will ever know , &quot; wrote Nation journalist Mut@@ uma Ma@@ thi@@ u , descri@@ bing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life .
&quot; left to themselves , politicians would bank@@ rupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering , &quot; he wrote .
Ken@@ yan law@@ makers have been the target of public anger in the past .
in May they voted to over@@ turn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and re@@ inst@@ ate their hef@@ ty salaries of around 5@@ 32@@ ,000 shi@@ ll@@ ings a month tax @-@ free - ran@@ ked among the highest in the world .
bad @-@ DÃ¼r@@ r@@ heim : a dream comes true for the FC
the official inau@@ gu@@ ral ceremony for the a@@ stro @-@ tur@@ f sports field did not wan@@ e in significance for the town and the football club , in spite of the cold weather and rain .
everyone had hoped for more pleasant conditions for the ceremony last Saturday , however the weather go@@ ds chose not to cooperate .
so anyone who came without an umbrel@@ la , or for whatever reason could not hold onto one , drew the short stra@@ w .
this was the case for the musicians who accompanied the ceremony , as well as for a number of speakers .
thus , FC Chairman Al@@ bre@@ cht Sch@@ len@@ ker , who spoke of the fulfil@@ ment of a dream , also got fairly wet .
his thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Kl@@ um@@ pp , who was heavily involved in the realisation of the project , the Town Council , the companies involved and club members who played a part .
particular mention went out to Lo@@ th@@ ar H@@ eld , Paul Wei@@ zen@@ eg@@ ger , H@@ einer G@@ ail and Peter Gra@@ f .
the Spr@@ y pension@@ ers laid 400 square metres of fla@@ gging for the new paths .
this remarkable voluntary commitment was also hon@@ oured by Member of the State Parliament , Karl Rom@@ bach .
further words of gre@@ eting were issued to the town Sports Commissioner , Hu@@ bert Bai@@ er , the District Chair@@ person of the Southern Baden Foot@@ ball Association , Kun@@ o Ka@@ yan , and Friedrich K@@ nor@@ r from the planning office , who announced a donation to the club &apos;s youth division .
Mayor Kl@@ um@@ pp rec@@ alled that weather @-@ related influences in the Spring and Aut@@ umn had repeatedly aff@@ lic@@ ted the original sports field , to such an extent that it could not be played on .
it was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered , when the construction of a third pitch on the football club site or at the secondary school on Sal@@ inen@@ see Lake were considered .
both ideas were rejected .
six years ago , thoughts turned to laying an a@@ stro @-@ tur@@ f pitch , which was generally viewed as the perfect solution .
specific plans were drawn up two years ago , when the FC inher@@ ited the Sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in le@@ as@@ eh@@ old , promised a contribution of EUR 100@@ ,000 for the construction of the pitch and the state approved a subsidy of EUR 10@@ 4@@ ,000 .
in October 2012 , the Town Council decided to cover the remaining EUR 35@@ 6@@ ,000 of the total cost of EUR 5@@ 60@@ ,000 , sum@@ mar@@ ised Kl@@ um@@ pp .
work began on the 68 x 108 metre a@@ stro @-@ tur@@ f pitch on 4 June .
during the construction phase , which la@@ sted over three months , 3@@ ,000 cu@@ bic metres of earth were removed , of which half was used for the laying of a di@@ rt bike track .
Union and SP@@ D have continued their coalition negotiations , addressing the topics of internal affairs and justice .
to this end , the competent working group met this morning .
among other issues , topics discussed included direct democracy , the bri@@ ber@@ y of MP@@ s and the Federal Police .
during the morning , the Migration and Integration working group also sought to continue its discussions .
among the issues to be addressed was that of dual nationality , in which regard both sides have opposing ideas .
the SP@@ D would like to put an end to the pressure placed on immig@@ rant children to decide on one nationality - the Union re@@ jects the notion of a dual passport .
regarding the subject of traffic , which was not on the agenda for this Friday , the SP@@ D substan@@ ti@@ ated its opposition to a car toll charge promoted by the CS@@ U .
a toll road sti@@ cker would amount to a &quot; flat rate fee for frequent drivers and would thus be environmentally counter@@ productive , &quot; explained the SP@@ D negoti@@ ator for issues relating to traffic , Flori@@ an P@@ ron@@ old , in a letter to his parliamentary group .
there would be a threat of diver@@ ted traffic on country roads , which are already accident hot@@ spots .
the introduction of a toll for cars would also only be a first step , in P@@ ron@@ old &apos;s eyes .
&quot; there is the risk that the compensation for Germans would be abolished at a later point in time , &quot; he said .

Vienna Airport aboli@@ shes passenger call @-@ outs
Mr. Max Ma@@ ier , please make your way to Gate 24 .
in future , announ@@ cements such as this will no longer happen at Vienna International Airport .
the majority of lou@@ d@@ speaker announ@@ cements will cease - thus considerably reducing the noise level .
the goal of this adjustment is to create a more relaxing atmosphere .
as airport spo@@ kes@@ person Peter Kle@@ em@@ an announced to Radio Vienna that in adju@@ sting the approach towards announ@@ cements , Vienna Airport is following an international trend .
among others , the airports in Kop@@ en@@ hagen , Frankfurt and Dubai have already done away with the noisy call @-@ outs .
by doing away with these announ@@ cements - on average around 200 personal call @-@ outs come through the lou@@ d@@ speakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be cal@@ mer in future .
&quot; experience has also shown that these individual announ@@ cements are relatively sel@@ dom taken notice of , and at the same time , all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them , &quot; said Kle@@ em@@ an while chat@@ ting to the radio broad@@ ca@@ ster .
High@@ land Games in Kal@@ ten@@ hof
alongside bra@@ ke van pul@@ ling with tra@@ ctors , there will also be a second contest at the agricultural autumn festival at Kal@@ ten@@ hof from 6 to 8 September .
on Saturday 7 September , the High@@ land Games will start at 1 : 30 p.m.
while they are of course a Scottish tradition , they have been given a touch of Sw@@ ab@@ ian colour at the Kal@@ ten@@ hof event grounds .
teams and individual competitors will be pit@@ ted against one another in the discipl@@ ines of tos@@ sing the c@@ aber , hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e tos@@ sing and bu@@ cket carrying .
the c@@ aber is four and a half metres long and weigh@@ s 25 to 30 kilometres .
&quot; it isn &apos;t about the distance , &quot; explains organis@@ er Peter S@@ ai@@ le .
the log must be thrown ver@@ tically , som@@ er@@ sau@@ lt once and then finish lying straight .
this scores maximum points .
in tos@@ sing the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , it all comes down to accuracy .
hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es are thrown onto a pe@@ g from a distance of eight metres .
participants must then prove their skill and strength by carrying a bu@@ cket of water 50 metres .
time is recorded and water quantity measured in a v@@ at at the end .
two members of each &quot; cl@@ an &quot; or team can then take part in the individual competition .
the winners of the team and individual con@@ tests receive prizes .
teams can practice from 10 : 00 a.m.
suitable clothing is desirable - for example competitors can wear kil@@ ts .
however , Sw@@ ab@@ ian traditional clothing is also permitted .
the jud@@ ging panel will also award a few bonus points for &quot; out@@ fits . &quot;
registration is open until a few hours prior to the beginning of the competition .
with the Scottish @-@ Sw@@ ab@@ ian High@@ land Games and the tra@@ ctor pul@@ ling contest , which will begin half an hour be@@ fore@@ hand , there promises to be a great deal of action at the event grounds on Saturday .
in the evening , fans of bra@@ ss band music will be in for a treat of their own .
at 19 : 00 , the &quot; bi@@ rab@@ Ã¶h@@ m@@ ische &quot; ( a play on words all@@ u@@ ding to the regions pe@@ ar trees , Boh@@ em@@ ia , and perhaps their love of beer as well ! ) wind music group from SchÃ¶@@ m@@ berg , provide a great evening of entertainment .
the band plays lively pol@@ kas and mar@@ ches .
however , their re@@ pertoire also includes emo@@ tive wal@@ tz@@ es and a full big band sound .
Hein@@ z Ko@@ ch from Wei@@ len unter den R@@ innen will also be there , better known as the &apos; singing inn ke@@ eper and black s@@ aus@@ age bar@@ on . &quot;
in the past , he has appeared at the Christmas market in Dor@@ n@@ han and the Nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft ( F@@ ool &apos;s Guil@@ d event ) .
on Sunday , the L@@ ein@@ st@@ etten Music Society will enter@@ tain audi@@ ences with a morning session , with the B@@ Ã¶ff@@ ingen Far@@ mer &apos;s Band as guests from 2 : 00 p.m. , and then the &quot; Ol@@ dies &quot; will bring the celebrations to a close .
the celebrations will get under way on Friday , with the &quot; St@@ opp@@ el@@ ack@@ er &quot; ( Stu@@ b@@ ble Fi@@ eld ) party featuring DJ R@@ al@@ f .
other items in the itiner@@ ary on Saturday and Sunday include the vin@@ tage car and tra@@ ctor meet and exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry .
further attractions on Sunday are the cor@@ n ma@@ ze , the craft market and sheep sh@@ ear@@ ing .
specially for children , there is a pet@@ ting zo@@ o , &quot; stra@@ w bo@@ un@@ cy castle , &quot; tra@@ ctor driving ( under supervision ) and tra@@ ctor surfing .
the event is organised by the community hall association , the ski club and the &quot; Z@@ Ã¼n@@ d@@ kap@@ sel@@ e &quot; ( b@@ lasting cap@@ s ) tra@@ ctor enthusiasts .
an overview of milk and egg alternatives
ve@@ gan nutrition promotes vegetable alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .
mas@@ hed to@@ fu with plant cream , for example , serves as a substitute for quar@@ k cheese .
the Veget@@ arian Association will provide further examples on World Ve@@ gan Day on 1 November .
on the occasion of World ve@@ gan Day on 1 November , the Veget@@ arian Association of Germany will propose a host of ve@@ gan alternatives :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , while yo@@ gh@@ urt can be replaced by so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ urt .
so@@ ya , o@@ at , al@@ mond or rice milk can be used in place of milk .
plant whi@@ pping cream can replace traditional whi@@ pping cream .
there are also plant alternatives to eggs .
half a mas@@ hed , ri@@ pe banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake .
50 grams of app@@ le sau@@ ce or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of ground lin@@ seed plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are also suitable .
a dou@@ gh becomes flu@@ ff@@ y by replacing egg with a mixture of one tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of bak@@ ing powder , one tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of cor@@ n@@ fl@@ our and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of mineral water , for example .
50 grams of so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ urt or sil@@ ken to@@ fu can also fulfil this purpose .
according to information from the Veget@@ arian Association , around 800@@ ,000 Germans currently have a ve@@ gan diet , i.e. a 100 % vegetable diet .
sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in New York
on the way to their host families in We@@ ym@@ outh , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , the pupils of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald Gra@@ mm@@ ar School got to know the American city of New York .
after an eight @-@ hour flight , they headed straight for Bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn Bridge , via which the heart of the city , Manhattan , can be reached on foot .
from here there is a fascinating view of the world @-@ famous sky@@ line , which is particularly impressive in the evening light .
due to the time difference , the pupils had been on the go for almost 24 hours , however , true to the s@@ logan , &quot; the city never sle@@ eps , &quot; the day was round@@ ed off with a trip to Times Square .
in spite of a sh@@ ut@@ down , they were able to visit the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty on the second day , and climb the stat@@ ue on foot .
they then moved on to the Financial District , via Wall Street , to visit the 9 / 11 mem@@ orial .
on the third day , the pupils were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Building , enjoying the views from a height of 3@@ 73 metres .
they then made their way through the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle of the New York streets , via the Ro@@ cker@@ f@@ eller Center , to Central Park , which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Aut@@ umn sun .
following a short flight from New York to Boston , the pupils have now arrived with their host families and are experiencing the school day at We@@ ym@@ outh High School .
once again this year , on Saint Hu@@ bert &apos;s day , a Hu@@ bert mass will be celebrated in the Par@@ ish of St. Mari@@ en on H@@ Ã¼l@@ s@@ berg@@ strasse .
St. Hu@@ bert was , according to legend , a truly ru@@ th@@ less h@@ unter , who converted following a vision and was later appointed Bis@@ hop of L@@ Ã¼t@@ ti@@ ch .
hunting horn group &quot; Jag@@ dre@@ iter West@@ f@@ alen , &quot; under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Bri@@ git@@ te Kl@@ uth , played old , traditional French mel@@ o@@ dies on par@@ force hor@@ ns ( natural hor@@ ns in the key of E flat ) .
the wind players wear riding clothes , as they provide musical accomp@@ anim@@ ent mainly for riders , horses and p@@ acks of ho@@ unds on drag hun@@ ts .
the sol@@ em@@ n mass is to take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed Op@@ sch@@ lag stands out with a new cafÃ© .
one that invites you to ling@@ er a while and to come again .
one that wants to get its name out there .
according to dic@@ tion@@ aries , dÃ©@@ j@@ Ã  v@@ u is defined as a psychological phenomenon , which expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation .
in the case of a visit to the cafÃ© of the same name at the Op@@ sch@@ lag in Kle@@ ve County , with a view of the Rhein @-@ Wa@@ al University , it doesn &apos;t always have to remain a pure dÃ©@@ j@@ Ã  v@@ u feeling .
ultimately , this is precisely the aim of the cafÃ© with the wonderful name : to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a recur@@ ring basis , not just theore@@ tically , but tan@@ gi@@ bly .
because it is fun and simply beautiful .
a g@@ lance into the internal work@@ ings at Op@@ sch@@ lag 8 gives the on@@ lo@@ ok@@ er a positive feeling right from the outset .
with its ultra @-@ modern yet cosy cafÃ© ambience , it looks like a place designed to make you feel good .
the team here , with business fo@@ unders , Mir@@ j@@ am van der St@@ elt and Daniel BÃ¼@@ t@@ tner at the helm , spo@@ ils guests with a wide range of coff@@ ees and cocktails .
in addition to this , there are delicious c@@ akes or fresh@@ ly bak@@ ed bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes , filled to order .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves as restau@@ rate@@ urs prior to opening the ch@@ ic cafÃ© on the Op@@ sch@@ lag : they previously managed the &quot; Art Lounge &quot; in Kran@@ enburg .
by moving to Kle@@ ve on the Op@@ sch@@ lag , the friendly cafÃ© lovers hope to reach a wider audience .
not least through university customers .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; emphasises Daniel BÃ¼@@ t@@ tner .
in actual fact , here the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age bra@@ ckets .
speaking of cafÃ© lovers ...
the two friendly owners are motivated by their love of coffee .
they themselves enjoy the fra@@ grant , hot bre@@ w in a vari@@ et of formats .
es@@ presso fan
Daniel BÃ¼@@ t@@ tner is more of an es@@ presso fan , while Mir@@ j@@ am van der St@@ elt is the cap@@ pu@@ cc@@ ino drin@@ ker .
&quot; and a bag@@ u@@ ette with it - that &apos;s my thing , &quot; she revealed to the N@@ R@@ Z .
there have already been two events held in the brigh@@ tly lit cafÃ© .
or perhaps more accurately , one .
this is because the Hafen@@ fest took place more outside than in - CafÃ© DÃ©@@ j@@ Ã  V@@ u did not benefit from it .
however , there was also the Ring@@ el@@ nat@@ z evening .
the two 33 @-@ year @-@ olds found it &quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny . &quot;
but it was not for everyone .
perhaps this is why Daniel BÃ¼@@ t@@ tner is not a vocal fan of evening events : &quot; you just cannot please everyone . &quot;
and with an event , I am always only appealing to those who have expressed an interest in the special event .
for this reason , events will always be an exception to the rule for us .
&quot; we want to cause as little dis@@ ruption as possible to normal business . &quot;
that is to say : dÃ©@@ j@@ Ã  V@@ u also stands for reliability .
this is with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as the team and the fantastic setting on the Op@@ sch@@ lag in Kle@@ ve .
the street that is fast becoming a &apos; restaurant mile &apos; .
this is to the delight of many Kle@@ ve residents , guests from near and far and the students who are discovering the &apos; restaurant mile &apos; , and with it the CafÃ© DÃ©@@ j@@ Ã  V@@ u , for themselves .

a day of thanks with the M@@ G@@ V ( Male Ch@@ oral Society ) in D@@ in@@ ker
this year the &quot; Friedrich Wilhelm D@@ in@@ ker &quot; M@@ G@@ V issued an invitation to its 16@@ 5th anniversary celebration , which 52 guests , active sin@@ gers and their wi@@ ves were happy to accept .
in the clu@@ b@@ house at the &quot; Wit@@ te@@ borg &quot; Inn in D@@ in@@ ker , all those present enjoyed the friendly get @-@ together in the name of music .
traditionally , the anniversary celebration is also always the fitting occasion to be@@ sto@@ w hon@@ ours .
this time around , secre@@ tary Rol@@ f W@@ agen@@ er was delighted to receive the special &quot; Sing@@ er of the Year &quot; award .
&quot; not only have you kept countless records for us , but you have also done so much running around for us , and for this we offer our sincere thanks , &quot; said Cho@@ ir Chairman E@@ rich Sch@@ lot@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als by means of the presentation of &quot; activity Posi@@ es , &quot; this year went to Cho@@ ir Director Di@@ eter Schul@@ ze , with 44 attendance marks , followed by Hon@@ or@@ ary Chairman Hor@@ st Pi@@ er @-@ Ri@@ b@@ bert , the Chairman himself , and last year &apos;s &quot; Sing@@ er of the Year &quot; Friedrich Win@@ kler , each having attended 42 times .
fifth place went to Ar@@ tur Br@@ Ã¼ck@@ ner , responsible for organising music copies .
the Board of Directors gave special thanks to the team managed by inn@@ ke@@ eper , An@@ ge Pi@@ er @-@ Ri@@ b@@ bert , which once again delighted those present with a top class menu , and to Ger@@ da Pi@@ er @-@ Ri@@ b@@ bert for the table decor@@ ations .
the &quot; Friedrich @-@ Wilhelm &quot; M@@ G@@ V meets for its regular cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als in the clu@@ b@@ house every Tuesday at 19 : 45 .
&quot; new voices that love to sing are more than welcome any time , &quot; said Sch@@ lot@@ mann .
UN ha@@ ils new goals to tackle poverty
the United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millenni@@ um development goals , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty .
Australian diplom@@ ats played a key role in pushing for &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; to replace the MD@@ G@@ s , which exp@@ ire in 2015 , ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Jan@@ eiro overnight .
they were included in the final draft of the document , which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms G@@ ill@@ ard during the summit .
UN Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to &quot; rise above national interests . &quot;
&quot; I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - SD@@ G@@ s , &quot; he said .
these SD@@ G@@ s will build on our advances under the millenni@@ um development goals , and they will be an integral part of the post @-@ 2015 development framework .
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MD@@ G@@ s .
even though the S@@ G Ach@@ im / Baden has gone four match days without victory , a positive mood is still prevailing within the top flight hand@@ ball team .
tra@@ iner Tom@@ as@@ z Mal@@ mon will not let there be any doubt of this fact .
everyone is still fully motivated for the task at hand .
that said , I do hope that we finally start winning again .
&quot; I no longer remember how a victory like that tastes , &quot; said Mal@@ mon , anticip@@ ating success for his team at V@@ f@@ L Fre@@ den@@ beck II .
even though the third @-@ tier reserves from Fre@@ den@@ beck are no &apos;t exactly in the best form at the moment , Mal@@ mon has issued a warning in advance
I trained many of the players myself in the A @-@ Youth .
consequently , they will be particularly motivated playing against their former coach .
&quot; in addition , we will have to wait and see whether rein@@ for@@ cements from the first team will be there , &quot; explained the S@@ G coach .
in any case , if they are to finally get back on the winning track , Mal@@ mon &apos;s team will have to improve on recent performances .
there have been major problems , primarily in terms of covering and counter att@@ acking .
the team &apos;s eye for the goal must be considerably improved .
therefore , I hope that my players have finally managed to clear their heads during the short break .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que security concerns mount as powerful person@@ alities clas@@ h
with a stat@@ ue of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s founding president , star@@ ing down on them , thousands of people gathered in central Map@@ u@@ to to chant peace slo@@ gans in a rare public demonstration .
&quot; we want peace back ; we want stability , &quot; said Van@@ ess@@ a de S@@ ous@@ a , chief executive of an investment company .
fe@@ ar@@ ful about the future of her country , she sw@@ apped her corporate atti@@ re for a T @-@ shirt em@@ bla@@ z@@ oned with &quot; we demand security &quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crow@@ ds in the capital &apos;s In@@ dependence Square on Thursday .
for two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clas@@ hes between government forces and R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O , some of the worst sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .
R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O was once a not@@ orious re@@ bel movement , initially backed by white @-@ ruled R@@ ho@@ des@@ ia and then South Africa &apos;s apar@@ thei@@ d government as part of efforts to destabili@@ se the country &apos;s independent government .
after a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party .
an@@ alyst@@ s believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full @-@ blo@@ wn conflict , but recent events have un@@ ner@@ ved foreign investors and locals .
the stak@@ es are high for the fast @-@ growing economy as the discovery of huge off@@ shore gas reserves and coal deposits in the nor@@ thwest could bring in more than $ 50@@ bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio T@@ into , V@@ ale of Brazil , En@@ i of Italy and An@@ ad@@ ark@@ o of the US .
the ruling Fre@@ lim@@ o party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O blame each other for the tension .
R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O says the government initiated the latest clas@@ hes by launching an attack on its members in So@@ fal@@ a province , traditionally a R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O stron@@ gh@@ old , on October 17 .
ass@@ aults on the former reb@@ els then escal@@ ated as government forces attacked R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O bases and attempted to kill Af@@ on@@ so D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama , the group &apos;s leader , Fern@@ ando Ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga , R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man , told the Financial Times .
the government bl@@ ames R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O for trig@@ gering the clas@@ hes , acc@@ using it of att@@ acking soldiers .
President Ar@@ mand@@ o Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to play down concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za told AF@@ P , the French news agency , on Wednesday that Mr D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama saw himself as a &quot; loser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions . &quot;
both Fre@@ lim@@ o and R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O insist they want to avoid war .
but concerns have grown after Mr Ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga was quoted as saying R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O was aband@@ oning the 1992 peace acc@@ ord .
he told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Fre@@ lim@@ o .
&quot; our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with seri@@ ousness , &quot; Mr Ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga said .
previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fu@@ elled by a series of clas@@ hes this year .
&quot; it &apos;s two big men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) but@@ ting heads together , &quot; said Joseph Han@@ lon , a lec@@ tur@@ er at the Open University and Moz@@ ambi@@ que expert .
neither of them are good negoti@@ ators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary .
R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O , which has been pushing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would bo@@ yc@@ ott municipal elections due in November .
presidential and parliamentary po@@ lls are scheduled for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spo@@ ils from the government .
R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O &apos;s share of the vote has been dec@@ lining since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , the Democratic Mo@@ vement of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( MD@@ M ) which was formed by a former R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga says Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he does not want multi @-@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; Mr Ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga said .
it is unclear how much capacity R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O has , but it has carried out dis@@ rup@@ tive hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north @-@ south highway .
most of the sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes have taken place in So@@ fal@@ a province , which is several hundred kilometres north of Map@@ u@@ to , but hosts Bei@@ ra , the port that min@@ ers , including Rio T@@ into and V@@ ale , rely on to export coal .
in June , Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O threatened to attack the line .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga was co@@ y when asked about whether R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O would repeat this threat .
R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things were not going well in Moz@@ ambi@@ que , &quot; Mr Ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga said .
the instability has added to fru@@ strations with the government , says Fern@@ ando Lim@@ a , head of Medi@@ ac@@ oo@@ p , an independent media company , with many people also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent sp@@ ate of ki@@ dn@@ app@@ ings .
&quot; people think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , &quot; he says .
O@@ mar Sul@@ tu@@ ane , a demonstr@@ ator , said people just wanted stability .
&quot; no one ca@@ res about R@@ EN@@ AM@@ O and Fre@@ lim@@ o , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads , &quot; he said .
children should be taught my@@ ths and legen@@ ds as &quot; models for a way of life , &quot; author says .
tal@@ es of Th@@ or could show &quot; bru@@ te strength is no match for sub@@ tle tri@@ ck@@ ery , &quot; while the Ar@@ th@@ uri@@ an legen@@ ds reveal the importance of having a dream .
saying many of the my@@ ths would be &quot; far too wild , far too sc@@ andal@@ ous and in some cases far too fil@@ thy to be taught in schools , &quot; Cro@@ ss@@ ley @-@ Holland advocated a &quot; careful selection &quot; of age @-@ appropriate works .
&quot; I find it wonderful that in America , my@@ th and fol@@ kl@@ ore already has a part in education , &quot; he said .
I have been advoc@@ ating it as a plan for twenty years .
he added authors and teachers being &quot; over@@ tly did@@ ac@@ tic &quot; is a &quot; total switch @-@ off &quot; for children , with messages being &quot; su@@ bli@@ min@@ ated &quot; in enjoyable stories .
Cro@@ ss@@ ley @-@ Holland , who has translated Be@@ ow@@ ulf from An@@ gl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on as well as writing the Pen@@ gu@@ in Book of Nor@@ se My@@ ths and British Fol@@ k T@@ ales , said : &quot; you may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight . &quot;
perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope .
not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending , but that there is an inn@@ ate sense of good and evil .
and that must be su@@ bli@@ min@@ ated ; revealed through a story rather than stated .
the old basis of showing not telling .
H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob back in FRE@@ I@@ H@@ OF once again
100 years ago , Heinrich H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob moved into his retirement home in Has@@ la@@ ch , on Sunday his final years in the &quot; FRE@@ I@@ H@@ OF &quot; were brought to life .
the large audience was inspired by the extremely am@@ using role play .
from his arrival , to his being confer@@ red with hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship and his death , A@@ lo@@ is Kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k , the scri@@ p@@ tw@@ rit@@ er and actor portra@@ ying H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob , has written an enter@@ taining play , which received great acc@@ la@@ im under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Cor@@ ne@@ lia Vol@@ k .
Mar@@ cus Z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann , serving as nar@@ r@@ ator , guided the audience through the ten different scenes , explained circumstances and provided links explaining le@@ aps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retirement .
on 22 October 19@@ 13 , H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob returned home to his childhood paradise , to his FRE@@ I@@ H@@ OF .
it was there that the role @-@ play began , with A@@ lo@@ is Kra@@ f@@ c@@ zy@@ k sh@@ ining once again in his famous role as the town &apos;s great son .
true to style , he trav@@ elled with a two @-@ horse carriage drawn by &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ Ã¤l@@ der FÃ¼@@ ch@@ sen &quot; ( Black Forest Ch@@ est@@ nut Hor@@ ses ) owned by E@@ rich Be@@ cher@@ er from M@@ Ã¼h@@ len@@ bach .
not only was he received with great applause from the audience , but was also welcomed by his sister Philipp@@ ine .
Bil@@ ly S@@ um @-@ Her@@ mann managed un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably well to place herself in the role of the sister and brought the character to life amaz@@ ingly well , in terms of both her expressions and gest@@ ures .
between the individual scenes , the M@@ Ã¼h@@ len@@ b@@ acher Bau@@ ern@@ kap@@ elle played appropriately selected musical pieces , thus round@@ ing off the performance .
the honour of presenting the title of hon@@ or@@ ary citizen went to Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s Mayor , Hein@@ z Win@@ kler , who , together with a section of the Town Council , made an appearance representing the Mayor of H@@ Ã¼t@@ ti@@ ch from back in H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob &apos;s day .
the &quot; Drei@@ kÃ¶@@ nig &quot; sin@@ gers then made their own appearance , leading H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob to exc@@ la@@ im : &quot; Oh how beautiful , this brings childhood memories of my own time in a Drei@@ kÃ¶@@ nig group back to life . &quot;
with their song , &quot; O Jes@@ u@@ le@@ in , &quot; they delighted the audience in the FRE@@ I@@ H@@ OF , as did the &quot; Stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der &quot; with their loud cri@@ es of &quot; her@@ aus , her@@ aus &quot; .
in his day , H@@ ans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob expressed his criticism of the institutional church , as well as his concerns regarding the exc@@ esses in the rural economy , the consequences of industri@@ alisation and the effects of the war .
he found his place of rest on his native soil , behind his m@@ aus@@ ol@@ e@@ um on the Brand near Hof@@ st@@ etten .
the role @-@ play ended with the words &quot; A rest@@ less spirit finally found rest and returned home forever . &quot;
the performance received great applause and many words of praise from the audience .
bas@@ ketball : hopes are growing for the Ne@@ ck@@ ar Ri@@ esen ( Ne@@ ck@@ ar Gi@@ ants ) .
the chances of the re@@ leg@@ ated Lud@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg Bu@@ des@@ lig@@ a bas@@ ketball players remaining in the le@@ ague have improved .
this is because there is to be a wild card procedure , and the Ne@@ ck@@ ar Ri@@ esen are now up against one applicant fewer .
the Hamburg To@@ wers bas@@ ketball project is dec@@ lining to make an application for a possible stand @-@ in place .
&quot; we will not participate in the wild card process , &quot; said former national team player Pas@@ cal Rol@@ ler , who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the H@@ ansa town since 2012 .
however , there was no si@@ gh of relief to be heard from Lud@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg .
&quot; we are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that DÃ¼sseldorf is not receiving a licence , &quot; said bo@@ ss of the Ne@@ ck@@ ar Ri@@ esen Alexander Rei@@ l , speaking to our paper .
newly promoted DÃ¼sseldorf Bas@@ k@@ ets have until 23 May to submit documents to the arbit@@ ration panel and prove their financial fitness for the Bundes@@ lig@@ a .
however , the R@@ hin@@ eland team have already been refused the licence twice .

the crow@@ ning gl@@ ory will be a visit to the Ab@@ end@@ ma@@ hl@@ sk@@ ir@@ che .
there the participants of the tour will be told the story of the construction of the church and will gain insight into the development of the Prote@@ stant con@@ gre@@ gation , in what is a Catholic area through and through .
last but not least , while in the church eyes will also turn to the last supp@@ er painting , painted by Friedrich SchÃ¼@@ z with the support of Walter K@@ rÃ¶@@ ll and Georg Hal@@ br@@ it@@ ter .
it is a fai@@ thful reproduction of the famous work Leonardo da Vinci in Milan .
the meeting point for the one and a half hour tour is the Nu@@ clear B@@ under Museum , at 3 : 00 p.m.

the Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch Town Tourist Office is available for questions and to provide you with information .
Snow@@ den may make further statements in Russia
the former US intelligence expert , Edward Snow@@ den , may make further statements regarding the US es@@ pion@@ age scandal from his Russian asylum .
representatives of the Federal Pro@@ sec@@ utor could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30 @-@ year @-@ old in person in Russia .
this was reported by the Inter@@ fax Agency with reference to groups aware of the situation , which were not named in greater detail .
such matters are to be clarified at an intergovernmental level , it was stated .
a departure of Snow@@ den from Russia is virtually impossible .
&quot; if this were to happen , he would lose his status as a refugee , &quot; said the Agency , quot@@ ing their source .
because Germany is an ally of the USA , Snow@@ den would be at risk of de@@ port@@ ation if he were to travel there , the source continued .
en@@ dur@@ ance pays divi@@ den@@ ds
six teams batt@@ led to become champion at the club tennis tournament .
in the end , it was the en@@ dur@@ ance of the Ma@@ ier / Bron@@ ner team that decided the final match .
the tennis division of the Sport@@ fre@@ unde Rohr@@ dorf ( Rohr@@ dorf Sports Fans ) enjoyed perfect weather for the tournament for local clubs and enthusiasts .
the focus of the tournament was on the fun of playing tennis .
five matches were scheduled for each team , with every team playing one match against all the others .
the matches were doub@@ les matches with a long set up to nine points , or a maximum duration of 45 minutes .
An@@ ja Sch@@ lich@@ ter managed the tournament
the organisation of the tournament was placed in the tru@@ sty hands of An@@ ja Sch@@ lich@@ ter , who was supported by Carmen MÃ¼ller and In@@ ga Kron@@ em@@ e@@ yer .
after the first three matches and a lunch break with past@@ a , the tournament moved into the crucial phase .
the favour@@ ites , And@@ re Ma@@ ier / Matthias Bron@@ ner , were tied with Michael Kli@@ pp@@ el and Sad@@ min Os@@ mi@@ ci@@ c ( both teams from the S@@ G Rohr@@ wei@@ ler ) , meaning that the last two games had to produce a vi@@ ctor .
at the awards ceremony , Carmen MÃ¼ller finally had the pleasure of presenting the Challenge Cup to And@@ re Ma@@ ier and Matthias Bron@@ ner , who had shown the greatest staying power on the final leg .
second place was taken by the Michael Kli@@ pp@@ el / Sad@@ min Os@@ mi@@ ci@@ c partnership .
bron@@ ze went to Ra@@ iner and Ber@@ nd Ma@@ ier of the A@@ sp@@ hal@@ trie@@ cher team .
in the late afternoon sun , accompanied by coffee and cake , the tournament drew to a successful close .
on the last weekend in August , the Vo@@ g@@ ts@@ bau@@ ern@@ hof Black Forest Open Air Museum in Gu@@ ta@@ ch near Hor@@ n@@ berg will once again be firmly in the hands of children .
traditionally , the museum welcomes visitors on a Saturday and Sunday , this year on on 24 and 25 August , to a colourful party for children and families as part of the summer holiday programme , with numerous participation activities and events .
&quot; on both days , adults and children alike can learn various traditional handi@@ crafts , &quot; said the press release .
whether producing so@@ ap , turning cand@@ les , fel@@ ting or making sil@@ k , there is a suitable activity whatever your age .
the children will receive help from regional arti@@ sans , present from 11.00 a.m. until 5 : 00 p.m.
activities will also be taking place in the museum workshop .
the young guests will be able to demonstrate their manual skills building cu@@ ck@@ oo pipes , water wheels or sp@@ inning tops .
the host of old games , such as whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row racing or walking on stil@@ ts , promises plenty of fun .
here speed and coordination are the order of the day .
for any mini@@ ature dete@@ c@@ tives , the open air museum will be offering a myst@@ ery tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday , at mid@@ day and 2.@@ 00 p.m. respectively .
on a tour of the premises , the children will have to work out which stories are true and which have been made up .
in addition , visitors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open air museum on a carriage journey drawn by Black Forest Ch@@ est@@ nut horses .
it is not just horses that can be found and admi@@ red on the grounds , but many other animals such as sheep , go@@ ats , co@@ ws and chi@@ ck@@ ens as well .
on the Sunday the children will also be able to enjoy the clo@@ wn , O@@ ts@@ ch , who will be doing p@@ ranks with the museum guests from 11.00 a.m.
meanwhile , a cosy and magical alternative will be provided by Her@@ mann BÃ¼@@ t@@ tner .
the story @-@ t@@ eller will be taking the younger guests to the wonderful world of fair@@ y@@ tale at 11.00 a.m. , 1 : 00 p.m. and 3 : 00 p.m.
the traditional children &apos;s dance group from Gu@@ ta@@ ch will also be performing at 11 : 30 a.m.
furthermore , on both event days , from 11.00 a.m. until 5.00 p.m. , numerous arti@@ sans such as the b@@ room maker , the se@@ wer , the sp@@ inner , the we@@ a@@ ver and the bak@@ er will be letting visitors look over their shoul@@ ders .
so , visitors to the open air museum can expect a varied holiday programme right through to the end of the summer holidays in Baden @-@ Wu@@ er@@ ttember@@ g .
in a small town in New Zealand , Bur@@ t Mun@@ ro is considered a lo@@ vable od@@ d@@ ball , all because he resolved to compete in a race in America with his 1920 motor@@ bike .
in spite of his heart defect , Bur@@ t could not be deter@@ red from pursuing his dream .
with his savings , a few donations and a mort@@ gage on his old workshop , he set off to Los Angeles by ship .
the film will be followed by coffee , tea and cake .
pi@@ er@@ cing be@@ ep distur@@ bs residents
R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ g@@ ard has also invested highly in land
they stock@@ pi@@ le the coal that arri@@ ves on ships .
at the same time , the company also has other ir@@ ons in the fire at the location .
besides coal imports , R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ g@@ ard is also active in the field of wind park logistics , among other vent@@ ures .
the co@@ als shi@@ mmer black in the storage yard in front of the em@@ bank@@ ment .
here two huge blue st@@ ack@@ er and rec@@ laim@@ er machines distribute or load the co@@ als as required .
with each movement of the handling machines , a sh@@ ri@@ ll warning noise rings out over the site .
&quot; the signals are for the purpose of security and are legally prescri@@ bed , &quot; said Matthias Schre@@ ll , Managing Director of R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ g@@ ard in Wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
unfortunately , in the event of un@@ favourable wind , they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in a position to make the warning signals qui@@ eter by means of the implementation of technical measures .
in future he will also seek open dialogue with neighbours .
for Matthias Schre@@ ll has some further plans at the location .
with the construction of the Lo@@ wer Sax@@ ony Bridge , R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ g@@ ard is continuing to focus on coal exports for power stations and is one of the major powers in this sector in Europe .
thanks to the mo@@ oring basin to the front of the terminal , sun@@ ken to a depth of 18.@@ 5 metres , it has for some time now been possible to un@@ load cap@@ esi@@ ze bulk carriers here .
&quot; in terms of handling , this year we hope to break the 3 million ton@@ ne mark , &quot; said Schre@@ ll .
alongside the local E@@ on power plant , the imported co@@ als also go to power plants inland .
when the G@@ DF @-@ Su@@ ez plant is added to the network , around 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic .
the three ship un@@ lo@@ aders on the bridge and the second transport belt could see this rise to 10 million .
Bavaria &apos;s bas@@ ketball players optimistic in spite of first defeat .
even their first defeat in the Euro@@ le@@ ague could not cur@@ tail the huge optim@@ ism of the FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers .
&quot; no @-@ one can stop us belie@@ ving that we can win , even against the best team in Europe over the last two years , &quot; assessed Bayern coach S@@ ve@@ ti@@ sla@@ v Pes@@ ic following the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) defeat to title defen@@ ders Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ Ã¤@@ us on Thursday evening .
we have delivered a message : bas@@ ketball also exists in Munich !
in their first three appe@@ aran@@ ces in the European top flight , the Munich team put in a good performance for long periods , but in the crucial phases were not sufficiently foc@@ uss@@ ed .
initially the guests managed to turn a 15 @-@ point deficit into a lead , with 13 minutes to go , before Pir@@ Ã¤@@ us was able to turn the game around once again .
&quot; we fought back incredibly well against the two @-@ time Euro@@ le@@ ague cham@@ pions , but then once again made care@@ less mistakes .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
Mal@@ col@@ m Del@@ an@@ ey and Ni@@ had D@@ jed@@ ovi@@ c were the most successful stri@@ kers for the Munich team , who had celebrated clear wins against the Italian Series cham@@ pions Monte@@ pa@@ sch@@ i Siena , and the Polish title @-@ holders , Ziel@@ ona G@@ Ã³@@ ra , in their first two games .
Ben Green@@ man : the T@@ enth An@@ ni@@ versary of the New York Com@@ edy Festival : the New Yor@@ ker
one could argue that New York City is the birth@@ place of stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , the v@@ au@@ de@@ vil@@ lian Frank F@@ ay , who served as the master of cerem@@ on@@ ies at the Palace Theatre , on Broad@@ way , started telling jo@@ kes directly to the crowd , in a convers@@ ational manner .
F@@ ay &apos;s innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the New York Com@@ edy Festival .
created and over@@ seen by Car@@ oline Hir@@ sch , the founder of the stan@@ du@@ p institution Car@@ ol@@ ines , the festival celeb@@ rates its tent@@ h anniversary this year , with more than six@@ ty shows at small clubs and large theatres .
&quot; most of these head@@ lin@@ ers appeared at Car@@ ol@@ ines , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;re too big to play a club , &quot; Hir@@ sch said .
we built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them .
this year &apos;s event includes appe@@ aran@@ ces by W@@ anda Sy@@ kes , Kath@@ y Gri@@ ff@@ in , and Bill Mah@@ er , as well as &quot; Stand Up for Her@@ oes , &quot; an annual music @-@ and @-@ com@@ edy benefit for military veter@@ ans , at Ma@@ dis@@ on Square Garden , featuring , among others , Bru@@ ce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , J@@ on Ste@@ wart , Roger Wat@@ ers , and Bill Co@@ s@@ by .
as the festival has expanded , so has the world of com@@ edy .
several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year &apos;s festival came up through non@@ traditional channels , such as shows on smaller networks , like Com@@ edy Central , F@@ X , and Spi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ roll rose to promin@@ ence on a deep @-@ cable sit@@ com ( F@@ X@@ X &apos;s gle@@ e@@ fully ra@@ un@@ chy fant@@ asy @-@ football @-@ them@@ ed &quot; The League &quot; ) and now has his own Com@@ edy Central sk@@ etch show .
J@@ enny S@@ late has been a cast member on both &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; and &quot; Parks and Rec@@ re@@ ation , &quot; though she is best known for her vi@@ ral video series &quot; Mar@@ cel the Shell with Sho@@ es On . &quot;
both K@@ roll and S@@ late , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans with distinctive voices ( the sur@@ really p@@ essimis@@ tic Anth@@ ony Jes@@ el@@ nik , the w@@ ry , ra@@ cially foc@@ uss@@ ed W. Kam@@ au B@@ ell ) , are products of the decentrali@@ zed world of American com@@ edy .
one of the festival &apos;s biggest draws will be an interview : David Steinberg talking to Lar@@ ry David .
Steinberg started as a stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edi@@ an but has become an accomplished television and film director , as well as an un@@ official com@@ edy hist@@ orian .
from 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot; S@@ it D@@ own Com@@ edy with David Steinberg . &quot;
the meeting takes place at Town Hall , in the center of Manhattan .
&quot; the city is definitely in the com@@ edy DNA of all of Lar@@ ry &apos;s work , &quot; Steinberg said .
he was telling me that , when he &apos;s here , sometimes he &apos;ll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself , H@@ ey , if I lose all my money , maybe I &apos;ll live here .
Iran satisfied with the nuclear negotiations process
Iran has expressed satisfaction with the negotiation process , one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany .
&quot; after many years , we have now reached an agreement with the International Nu@@ clear Energy Auth@@ orities to clear up the differences from past years , &quot; wrote Foreign Minister Moh@@ amm@@ ed D@@ sch@@ awa@@ d Sar@@ if on his Facebook page .
it will without doubt be a long path , but the chief nuclear negoti@@ ator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end .
drama in Uruguay : boys kill play@@ mate with mach@@ etes
two children have conf@@ essed to the murder of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old in Uruguay .
the two boys , aged 14 and 12 , had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them .
on Tuesday , armed with mach@@ etes and kni@@ ves , they stab@@ bed the 11 @-@ year @-@ old to death and thre@@ w the body into a well , reported the &quot; El Pa@@ Ã­@@ s &quot; newspaper on Thursday .
they then went and played football in front of their homes in a working class district .
the body was found the following night in the village of Cer@@ ro Pel@@ ado , 15 kilometres to the north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del E@@ ste .
a five year @-@ old half @-@ sister of the younger off@@ ender , who they took with them , was to make a statement as an ali@@ bi , stating that she was sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted by the boy .
however , when the girl described the pro@@ gression of events to the police without mentioning an attack against herself , the two boys conf@@ essed to the pre @-@ medi@@ t@@ ated murder of the 11 @-@ year @-@ old .
the older of the pair c@@ ited a ri@@ val@@ ry on the football field as the mo@@ tive .
he was provisi@@ on@@ ally taken to a psy@@ chiat@@ ric young offen@@ ders institute .
p@@ im@@ p must go to prison
the District Court of Con@@ stance has condemned a 33 @-@ year @-@ old man from St. Geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison for explo@@ it@@ ative human trafficking , p@@ imp@@ ing , issuing threats and gri@@ ev@@ ous bo@@ di@@ ly harm .
the former German soldi@@ er who , following two tours in Afghanistan , had worked as a door@@ man , made a con@@ fes@@ sion within the context of a ple@@ a @-@ bar@@ gaining procedure .
according to the con@@ fes@@ sion , on five occasions he got to know women via Internet or telephone contacts , who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few weeks .
he broke any resistance by means of violence and the issuing of threats .
he kept the income from women , some of whom worked for him for years .
he prevented the women from making contact with the outside world by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating their mobile phones and SI@@ M cards .
together with an accompli@@ ce , who pro@@ cu@@ red the women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the south @-@ west .
there he had them monitored to some extent , in order to control their income .
appearing before the court , the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trau@@ ma after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explosion .
once a psy@@ chiat@@ ric expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psy@@ chiat@@ ric condition , and thus on his limited culp@@ ability , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old made a full con@@ fes@@ sion .
the court did not have to question any more of the female victims .
as an official from the Criminal Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ation Department reported , following the first conviction achieved using telephone surveillance measures , at least four further cases of explo@@ it@@ ative human trafficking could be identified .
the inter@@ cep@@ ted convers@@ ations were characterised by a high level of ag@@ gression .
in subsequent hear@@ ings , the victims confirmed their or@@ deal .
a further witness , whereby one of the woman had suffered blue bru@@ ises all over her body , is yet to make a statement .
this is a case of a &quot; completely broken personality , &quot; that views the violence and exploitation in this field as normal .
yesterday the accused expressed regret for his behaviour .
&quot; I have removed myself from these circles and hope to lead a completely normal life following my im@@ prison@@ ment , &quot; he stated .
oil extends drop toward $ 96 a bar@@ rel
the price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China &apos;s power @-@ hung@@ ry manufacturing sector is strengthening .
bench@@ mark U.S. cru@@ de for December delivery was down 14 c@@ ents at $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 a bar@@ rel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange .
the contract fell 39 c@@ ents on Thursday , leaving it down 5.@@ 8 percent for the month of October .
ample supplies of cru@@ de have weigh@@ ed on the price in recent weeks .
the Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
over five weeks , supplies have risen by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
but a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an up@@ tick in activity .
that suggests China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth re@@ bound@@ ed to 7.@@ 8 percent in the third quarter from a two @-@ decade low in the previous quarter .
Br@@ ent cru@@ de , a bench@@ mark for international cru@@ de also used by U.S. refin@@ eries , fell 26 c@@ ents to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 a bar@@ rel on the ICE exchange in London .
Court blocks ruling on N@@ Y@@ PD stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k policy
a federal appe@@ als court on Thursday blocked a judge &apos;s order requiring changes to the New York Police Department &apos;s stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k program and removed the judge from the case .
the 2nd U.S. Cir@@ cu@@ it Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als said the decisions of Ju@@ dge Shi@@ ra Sch@@ ein@@ d@@ lin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city .
the judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and ques@@ tioning people .
the city appe@@ aled her findings and her re@@ medi@@ al orders , including a decision to assi@@ gn a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it .
the appe@@ als court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay .
the appe@@ als court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran af@@ oul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by com@@ promising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of parti@@ ality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court .
the judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wron@@ g@@ ly targe@@ ting black and His@@ pan@@ ic men with its stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k program .
she appointed an outside monitor to over@@ see major changes , including reforms in policies , training and supervision , and she ordered a pilot program to test body @-@ worn cameras in some prec@@ in@@ cts where most stops occur .
in August , New York City agreed to end the practice of st@@ oring the names and addresses of people whose cases are dis@@ missed after a police stop .
an oral argument on the city &apos;s appeal is scheduled for some@@ time after March 14 , 2014 .
the stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k tac@@ tic has been critici@@ zed by a number of civil rights advocates .
stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k has been around for decades in some form , but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Blo@@ om@@ berg to an all @-@ time high in 2011 of 68@@ 4,@@ 3@@ 30 , mostly of black and His@@ pan@@ ic men .
a law@@ suit was filed in 2004 by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case .
supporters of changes to the N@@ Y@@ PD &apos;s stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k program say the changes will end unfair practices , will m@@ old a more tru@@ sted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy .
opponents say the changes would lower police mor@@ ale but not crime , waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shr@@ in@@ king by thousands of officers during the last decade .
the judge noted she wasn &apos;t putting an end to the stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k practice , which is constitutional , but was reforming the way the N@@ Y@@ PD implemented its stops .
on the happiness of dre@@ aming cam@@ els
happiness is an oasis that only dre@@ aming cam@@ els manage to reach
it was with this piece of Bed@@ ou@@ in wisdom that the first ever chairman Wolfgang Hen@@ ne described the history and fasc@@ ination behind the &quot; Hel@@ ping Hand@@ s &quot; society .
Saturday evening saw the celebration of the tent@@ h birthday of the organisation , which can already look back on impressive results .
founding Chairman Hen@@ ne reported in depth on the work of the organisation .
in 2004 , he visited the Ch@@ ei@@ jk @-@ Z@@ aj@@ ed Hospital in N@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ott in Mau@@ rit@@ ania for the first time .
as a result , an important collaboration was developed and the g@@ yn@@ a@@ ec@@ ologist , Han@@ ne , has performed countless operations on several jour@@ neys to the location .
during the speech , images from the trips were shown on a large screen , in order to give the guests at the anniversary event an insight into the initiatives mentioned .
the organisation &apos;s desert vehicle was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
Ra@@ iner Pre@@ wo , the former Lord Mayor of Nag@@ old , made the suggestion of equi@@ pping this vehicle with a photo@@ volta@@ ic system and , according to Hen@@ ne , he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation .
in 2008 , the Schle@@ eh car@@ p@@ entry company from Bai@@ ers@@ bron@@ n built the hospital station in So@@ co@@ gi@@ m , a poor district on the edge of the Capital , in the record time of less than one week - free of charge .
Hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in N@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ott
this is particularly interesting at a time when Nag@@ old is set to do away with its mat@@ ernity clin@@ ic .
you learn a great deal working as a doctor in Africa , said Hen@@ ne , for example that you should slow down to avoid burn @-@ out .
due to the political un@@ rest in the country , it has not been possible to make as many jour@@ neys as planned , but for this reason , many local doctors have come to Germany , to sit in on lectures on a variety of topics .
in addition , containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa , for example in March of this year when medical devices , medicines , ban@@ da@@ ging material , hospital beds and spectac@@ les were sent .
co @-@ initi@@ ator Hans @-@ Jo@@ ach@@ im Fu@@ ch@@ tel himself provided plenty of local colour , telling of Mercedes vehicles in Mau@@ rit@@ ania converted into mobile go@@ at st@@ alls and sharing the experiences of the St@@ amm@@ heim musicians , who traditionally support the organisation on their trips to Mau@@ rit@@ ania .
he identified his personal motivation as being his work in the area of audi@@ ting as a young member of parliament .
when it became clear to him how much money is wa@@ sted , he decided to help the Afri@@ cans with controlling of their budget by the people .
Fu@@ ch@@ tel also emphasised that a global economy requires global human kin@@ dness .
the fact that Africa lies closer than many think should by no means be forgotten .
Africa is not at all that far from Gran Canaria .
C@@ oul@@ son used phone h@@ acking to verify tip
former News of the World editor An@@ dy C@@ oul@@ son alle@@ ge@@ dly used &quot; phone h@@ acking , surveillance and confron@@ tation &quot; in an attempt to confirm a bo@@ gu@@ s tip about an affair involving then @-@ home secre@@ tary Charles Clar@@ ke .
prosec@@ utor Andrew Edi@@ s Q@@ C told the Old Bai@@ ley that the News of the World heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that Clar@@ ke was seeing his &quot; attractive special advis@@ er , &quot; H@@ ann@@ ah Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
the newspaper t@@ asked private investig@@ ator G@@ len@@ n Mul@@ c@@ aire with h@@ acking Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ emails and &quot; door @-@ step@@ ped &quot; her , but C@@ oul@@ son also called and left her vo@@ ic@@ emails , the court heard .
&quot; the pro@@ secution suggests that Mr C@@ oul@@ son , who is now the editor of the Not@@ W , he is not the man who stands outside people &apos;s houses hoping to catch them out , he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say , &quot; Mr Edi@@ s said .
he said the Not@@ W used three ways to investigate stories : phone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation .
the editor is personally involved in the third .
obviously he knows about the second , surveillance , he must do .
what about the first ?
does he know about phone h@@ acking ?
he says he doesn &apos;t , we say &quot; Oh yes , he did . &quot;
rum@@ ours about an affair involving Clar@@ ke were first picked up by the Not@@ W &apos;s features desk when a source who was sex@@ ually interested in Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by was told : &quot; don &apos;t b@@ other wa@@ sting your time , she &apos;s with Charles . &quot;
a tape of vo@@ ic@@ emails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was sei@@ zed from Mul@@ c@@ aire &apos;s home in August 2006 .
investig@@ ators also found entries on the private investig@@ ator &apos;s computer which had Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her sister as &quot; Pro@@ jects . &quot;
during the period she was being investigated , Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received anonymous calls asking for information about her , Mr Edi@@ s said .
meanwhile , former chief re@@ porter Ne@@ ville Th@@ ur@@ l@@ beck and former re@@ porter James We@@ a@@ ther@@ up over@@ saw surveillance of Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s movements .
leaving her a vo@@ ic@@ email on June 18 2005 , C@@ oul@@ son told her : &quot; I &apos;ve got a story that we &apos;re planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about . &quot;
Mr Edi@@ s said C@@ oul@@ son &apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former home secre@@ tary David Bl@@ unk@@ ett .
the jury heard on Thursday that C@@ oul@@ son confronted Mr Bl@@ unk@@ ett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant Re@@ bek@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was married at the time .
C@@ oul@@ son and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny con@@ spir@@ ing with others to h@@ ack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006 .
Mul@@ c@@ aire , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ beck and We@@ a@@ ther@@ up have admitted phone h@@ acking .
in protest against the planned tax on the rich , the French Foot@@ ball Association is set to actually go through with the first strike since 1972 .
a mediation meeting comes to an end without resolution .
in the conflict regarding the tax on the wealthy , the government and the professional football association in France have manoeu@@ v@@ red into a cu@@ l @-@ de @-@ sa@@ c following a failed mediation meeting .
President FranÃ§ois Hol@@ lan@@ de welcomed club and association representatives to Paris &apos; Ã@@ l@@ ys@@ Ã©e Palace on Thursday , where he listened to their complaints .
however , he refused to spare the football association from the planned 75 % income tax to be imposed on those ear@@ ning in excess of one million â¬ per year , which every company in the country will have to pay for two years , from 2014 .
the opposition also remained ad@@ am@@ ant .
the strike announced for the end of November will now go ahead , informed the head of the Union of Professional Foot@@ ball Clubs ( UC@@ P@@ F ) , Jean @-@ Pierre Lou@@ vel .
the Lig@@ ue 1 and Lig@@ ue 2 match days scheduled between 29 November and 2 December will thus be cancelled .
Ge@@ ch@@ ingen : absolute protection not possible
&quot; we want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible , &quot; said Mayor J@@ ens H@@ Ã¤u@@ Ã@@ ler , opening the citizen &apos;s information event regarding the flood protection concept in Ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
around 80 participants came to the Gem@@ ein@@ de@@ halle ( community hall ) to have the planned measures explained to them , to express their concerns and submit ideas .
H@@ Ã¤u@@ Ã@@ ler made clear : &quot; the final decisions will be made by the members of the Town Council . &quot;
H@@ Ã¤u@@ Ã@@ ler comm@@ ented that the flood that found Ge@@ ch@@ ingen un@@ prepared on 15 May 2009 , was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the future .
a river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of Ai@@ d@@ lingen , which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in Ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; the goal is the protection of as many developed pl@@ ots of land as possible , &quot; said H@@ Ã¤u@@ Ã@@ ler .
the basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected floods , which statisti@@ cally occurs every 100 years , according to the German We@@ ather Service .
climate change is taken into account in the form of an allow@@ ance of 15 per cent .
in expert circles this is referred to as &quot; H@@ Q 100@@ a@@ Kli@@ ma . &quot;
the m@@ asses of water that caused considerable damage in Ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,000 @-@ year flood .
&quot; there is no such thing as absolute protection , but we can attempt to make a relative improvement , &quot; said H@@ Ã¤u@@ Ã@@ ler .
in order to achieve H@@ Q 100@@ a@@ Kli@@ ma protection , around four million â¬ must be invested in Ge@@ ch@@ ingen , whereby the town can count on a State subsidy of around 70 per cent .
however , H@@ Ã¤u@@ Ã@@ ler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed .
in order to develop such a concept , the town is reli@@ ant on the cooperation of its citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
in a best case scenario , implementation could begin in 20@@ 16 .
among other measures , the protection concept , which ( we reported ) has already been presented to the Town Council during the past week , plans local measures in the tri@@ but@@ ary to the River Ir@@ m , running from the St@@ amm@@ heim Valley .
in conjunction with the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns .
among others , the question was raised as to why em@@ bank@@ ments and detention reserv@@ o@@ irs are no longer planned to protect the location .
Greg@@ or KÃ¼h@@ n , technical plann@@ er at the commissioned engineering company , HÃ¼@@ gel@@ sh@@ eim @-@ based &apos; Wald und Cor@@ be &apos; , who presented the concept , emphasised that it required the inter@@ play of all proposed measures , in order that their sum might achieve the desired goal .
furthermore , the most economic solution must be found , said Jo@@ ach@@ im Wald of Wald und Cor@@ be .
there was res@@ ent@@ ment among local residents of the old town , who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the over@@ flo@@ wing of the canal network , even during normal th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms .
the problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken .
however , H@@ Ã¤u@@ Ã@@ ler indicated that the guidelines for canal systems are different to those for flood protection , and these must not be confused .
the town is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that it can with@@ stand ra@@ inf@@ all events every two to three years .
to make the se@@ wer@@ age channels wider would g@@ ob@@ ble up millions .
persons seriously injured following col@@ li@@ sion
early on Friday afternoon , two car drivers were seriously injured in a head @-@ on col@@ li@@ sion on Landes@@ straÃe 44 ( a rural road ) .
the police completely blocked off the road immediately , but initially could not make much comment on the cause of the accident .
however , they did mention that there were various witness statements that first had to be assessed .
what is certain is that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old female driver of a V@@ W Golf was driving in the direction of Re@@ v@@ ens@@ dorf and the 38 @-@ year @-@ old man from G@@ ett@@ or@@ f came towards her in his Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
the two vehicles col@@ li@@ ded , whereby the woman was so severely stuck that it took the fire service almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle w@@ reck@@ age .
initially the actual cause of the accident remained unclear .
both unfortunate parties were taken to nearby hospitals .
the road remained fully blocked off for around two hours .

issuing statements regarding the Merkel sp@@ ying scandal from Russia
the former US intelligence expert , Edward Snow@@ den , may make further statements regarding the US es@@ pion@@ age scandal involving Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , from his Russian asylum .
representatives of the German Federal Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30 @-@ year @-@ old in person in Russia , reported the Inter@@ fax Agency .
green Party parliament representative , Hans @-@ Christian Str@@ Ã¶@@ bel@@ e , was yesterday the first German politician to meet with Snow@@ den in Moscow , to discuss the scandal with him .
N@@ SA revel@@ ations boost corporate par@@ ano@@ ia about state surveillance
on a mild day in late August a German police helicopter bu@@ z@@ zed low over the US consul@@ ate in Frankfurt , the financial capital of Germany .
on the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ F@@ V ) , Germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , its mission was to photogra@@ ph the ro@@ of@@ top of the US out@@ post , which is located less than 5@@ km from the European Central Bank and Bundes@@ bank .
German media say the B@@ F@@ V hoped to identify the presence of listening anten@@ n@@ as and the action promp@@ ted an exchange between the US and the German foreign mini@@ stry in Berlin .
James Cla@@ pper , US Director of National Intelli@@ gence , insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot; to ste@@ al the trade secre@@ ts of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line . &quot;
but ever since Edward Snow@@ den , the contra@@ ctor turned whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , began rele@@ asing his treas@@ ure tro@@ ve of US surveillance secre@@ ts , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word .
reports that the US National Security Agency spi@@ ed on Brazilian oil company Pet@@ ro@@ br@@ as and gained access to data held by US clou@@ d providers including Google and Yahoo have rat@@ ch@@ eted corporate par@@ ano@@ ia about state surveillance to new high@@ s .
the final stra@@ w came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s phone had been bu@@ gged , possibly for about a decade .
if Europe &apos;s most powerful person can be targeted , then surely business leaders are also potential targets .
Snow@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies .
I think it &apos;s concei@@ vable that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; Germany must wake up , &quot; says Oliver Gr@@ Ã¼@@ n , president of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , which represents small and medium sized German IT companies .
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to a survey published in July by E@@ Y , the consultancy .
in all the documentation le@@ aked by Mr Snow@@ den , there has , however , been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies &apos; trade secre@@ ts to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US .
business leaders are scep@@ tical about this .
someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google .
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again ...
&quot; that &apos;s not the way , &quot; H@@ asso Plat@@ tner , chairman of German business software company SAP , says .
if one wanted a strong European IT industry , then one sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have let it die out 20 years ago .
everything is subsi@@ dis@@ ed in Germany , from coal , to cars and farmers .
everything but the IT industry .
still , the reach and technical sophistic@@ ation of US sp@@ y agencies exposed by the Snow@@ den revel@@ ations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China .
a big shift is occurring in clou@@ d comp@@ uting where European exec@@ u@@ tives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey carried out by the C@@ loud Security Alliance , a trade body , some 10 per cent of non @-@ US members cancelled plans to use a US @-@ based clou@@ d provider after revel@@ ations about the US P@@ ris@@ m data mining programme .
J@@ im Sn@@ abe , co @-@ chief executive at SAP , says : &quot; we see a new question from customers that didn &apos;t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physi@@ cally in that jurisdiction . &quot;
many German exec@@ u@@ tives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most pri@@ zed secre@@ ts and these data must therefore be gu@@ arded at all costs .
that economic sp@@ ying takes place is not a surprise .
it has always taken place .
&quot; this has been a topic for many years and has@@ n &apos;t fundamentally changed through the current discussion , &quot; says Kur@@ t Bo@@ ck , chief executive of chemical maker BAS@@ F .
the Americans sp@@ y on us on the commercial and industrial level as we sp@@ y on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
corporate leaders are not generally keen to bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures they have taken , in case this hands an advantage to an attack@@ er .
for large companies , the message has long since been dru@@ mm@@ ed home that pi@@ cking up a free USB stick at a trade fair , or leaving a laptop ung@@ u@@ arded in a hotel room are un@@ wise , to say the least .
Ulrich Hack@@ en@@ berg , board member at car@@ maker Au@@ di , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices .
Germany &apos;s B@@ F@@ V advis@@ es exec@@ u@@ tives to consider using simple prep@@ aid mobil@@ es when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are com@@ promised .
the prep@@ aid mobil@@ es are then thrown away afterwards .
however , there is concern that small and medium @-@ sized companies remain vulnerable to h@@ acking and surveillance .
in Germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular nich@@ e .
&quot; small and medium sized companies often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secre@@ ts effectively against un@@ authorised access , &quot; the B@@ F@@ V war@@ ns in a report .
the US war@@ ns its own companies about economic es@@ pion@@ age by other countries .
the US National Intelli@@ gence E@@ stim@@ ate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offen@@ ders who engage in h@@ acking for economic intelligence , behind China , according to The Washington Post .
a board member at a German blue @-@ chip company con@@ cur@@ red that when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , &quot; the French are the worst . &quot;
Bern@@ ard S@@ quar@@ c@@ ini , former head of the French internal intelligence agency D@@ CR@@ I , was quoted in an interview this month as saying : &quot; the services know perfectly well that all countries , even as they co @-@ operate in the anti@@ terrorist fight , sp@@ y on their allies . &quot;
He@@ ch@@ ingen : trade fair provides the answers to wedding questions
&quot; marriage is and remains the most important journey of discovery a person can undertake , &quot; said the philosop@@ her S@@ Ã¶r@@ en K@@ ier@@ ke@@ ga@@ ard .
tips , at least as to how the wedding celebration can be a success , have now been given at a special trade fair in the Dom@@ Ã¤n@@ e in He@@ ch@@ ingen .
important suppliers of all wedding @-@ related products and services were represented .
a trend : the re@@ tro look is back once again .
this begins with the wedding clothing .
white is a must , best mut@@ ed or in cream .
at the front , dres@@ ses with numerous ru@@ ff@@ les and em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y are in , often with a v@@ eil , while to the rear they run down the back and often end in a train .
however , opinions differ , as Ste@@ fan@@ ie Ko@@ ch from the Mo@@ de@@ haus K@@ lei@@ der@@ mÃ¼@@ ller emphasised .
for men , suits with a wa@@ ist@@ coat and ne@@ cker@@ chief are most popular , although some people do choose cream or brown combinations .
selecting the venue is important , it was explained .
plain ad@@ joining rooms are not ideal , the ambience should be special .
in this regard , the Dom@@ Ã¤n@@ e drew attention to their own facilities in the carriage house .
U@@ we Link has an offer for anyone who wants to set off in a carriage .
&quot; however , carri@@ ages are also popular for hen parties , &quot; he comm@@ ented .
people were also on the lo@@ ok@@ out for romantic ideas for inv@@ it@@ ations , flower arrangements and wedding photographs .
the &quot; After @-@ Wed@@ ding Photo &quot; is becoming increasingly fashionable - that is , series of pictures taken a few days after the celebration , at special locations , prefer@@ ably in front of water@@ falls or the like , but in full wedding clothing , explained Elisa@@ beth K@@ ei@@ del .
many other details for a successful wedding were presented in the Dom@@ Ã¤n@@ e on Sunday .
flower arrangements , rings , wedding tables , c@@ akes and also a ma@@ gi@@ cian , such as Mark@@ o Ri@@ p@@ per@@ ger , who can enter@@ tain guests with style .
the correct cosme@@ tics and nail care mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t be forgotten .
everything you need for an unforgettable celebration .

parents of Georgia teen who died in &apos; fre@@ ak accident &apos; believe son was murdered
the parents of a Georgia teen@@ ager , whose body was found inside a rolled @-@ up w@@ rest@@ ling m@@ at in his high school gym , believe their son was murdered , the family &apos;s att@@ or@@ ney said Thursday .
K@@ end@@ ri@@ ck Johnson , of Val@@ do@@ sta , G@@ a . , was found Jan@@ . 11 stuck in an u@@ pri@@ ght m@@ at pro@@ pped behind the ble@@ ach@@ ers inside his high school gym .
Lo@@ wn@@ des County sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s investig@@ ators concluded Johnson died in a fre@@ ak accident , but the 17 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s family disputes that .
&quot; they absolutely think their son was murdered , &quot; Benjamin C@@ rum@@ p , an att@@ or@@ ney representing Kenne@@ th and J@@ acqu@@ el@@ yn Johnson , told Fo@@ x@@ New@@ s.@@ com.
they never believed he died the way the sh@@ eri@@ ff concluded .
&quot; they believe that it de@@ fies logic , the laws of physi@@ cs as well as common sense , &quot; C@@ rum@@ p said .
they think this is a cover @-@ up to protect the person or people responsible for their son &apos;s death .
&quot; they sent their son to school with a book @-@ bag and he was returned to them in a body bag , &quot; he said .
U.S. Att@@ or@@ ney Michael Mo@@ ore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson &apos;s death , not@@ ing that several key questions remain un@@ answered .
what was the cause of death ?
was his death the result of a crime ?
Mo@@ ore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon .
I will follow the facts wherever they lead .
my objective is to discovery the truth .
&quot; I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists &quot; for a formal investigation , he said .
Mo@@ ore told re@@ por@@ ters that the initial au@@ top@@ sy indicated Johnson died as a result of &quot; posi@@ tional as@@ phy@@ xi@@ a . &quot;
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , listed a different cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
&quot; there are several questions that must be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
Mo@@ ore added that if he un@@ covers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the F@@ BI to conduct it .
a representative from the Lo@@ wn@@ des County Sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s Office was not immediately available for comment when cont@@ acted Thursday .
a southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investig@@ ators reviewed .
the teen@@ ager &apos;s parents said they hope the video foot@@ age will contain clu@@ es to how he died .
CD@@ C issues children &apos;s aller@@ gy guidelines for schools
on Wednesday , the Cent@@ ers for Dis@@ ease Control and Pre@@ vention released a set of guidelines to manage children &apos;s food aller@@ gies at school .
this is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out , as the number of school @-@ age children suffering from food aller@@ gies climb@@ s .
one in 20 children in the United States now have food aller@@ gies .
the CD@@ C found the pre@@ val@@ ence of food aller@@ gies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
the guide contains information for schools on how to make fac@@ ul@@ ty and staff aware of children &apos;s food aller@@ gies , and how to handle them should an aller@@ gic reaction occur .
it also recommends schools have ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine sto@@ cked -- the Epi@@ Pen brand auto @-@ injec@@ tor being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fat@@ al an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ xis .
state legislat@@ ures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine more easily .
the report also includes a list of typical symptoms communic@@ ated by children who are having an aller@@ gic reaction .
kids may say , &quot; It feels like something is po@@ king my tongue , &quot; &quot; My tongue feels like there is hair on it , &quot; or &quot; My tongue is ting@@ ling . &quot;
parents of inter@@ sex Ki@@ ds Can P@@ ick &apos; Gender Un@@ determin@@ ed@@ &apos;
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for bab@@ ies born with ambiguous gen@@ itali@@ a .
no longer will new@@ bor@@ ns be rigi@@ dly assigned to male or female .
the new law doesn &apos;t require parents to declare any gender for such children , allowing parents to declare gender &quot; un@@ determined &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; on their birth certificates .
the aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make ha@@ sty decisions on sex @-@ assign@@ ment surgery for new@@ bor@@ ns , and to fight discrimination against those who are inter@@ sex .
one inter@@ sex person , according to the BBC , said years later , &quot; I am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , bru@@ ised and scar@@ red .
an estimated one in 2@@ ,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl .
they are inter@@ sex , part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development , an umbrel@@ la term for those with at@@ yp@@ ical chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , gon@@ ads ( o@@ varies or te@@ stes ) , or un@@ usually developed gen@@ itali@@ a .
Wal@@ lis Simp@@ son may have been inter@@ sex .
gender identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined , it &apos;s better to use the best available information to assi@@ gn it then to wait and monitor the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery , if at all .
new York City psy@@ chiat@@ r@@ ist Dr. Jack Dre@@ scher , who speciali@@ zes in issues of gender identification , said the new German law &quot; sounds like a good thing . &quot;
inter@@ sex children pose ethical di@@ lemma .
&quot; some people have life @-@ endan@@ gering conditions that require surgery , but most kids do not , &quot; he said .
you can make a gender assign@@ ment without surgery , and then see how identity develops .
the science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate .
nobody can answer the questions about why this happens .
it &apos;s like the myst@@ ery of why people are gay .
a report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described inter@@ sex people as different from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender people , as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological mak@@ eu@@ p , which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female , but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either .
these features can mani@@ fest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics , such as mus@@ cle mass , hair distribution , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure ; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and gen@@ itali@@ a ; or in chro@@ mo@@ som@@ al structures and hormon@@ es .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sex and trans@@ gender people in the realm of employment , as well as levels of harass@@ ment , violence and bias crimes .
gender non@@ con@@ forming boys now have special camp .
already , Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male , female or a &quot; third gender &quot; on their official documents .
in June , a 52 @-@ year @-@ old Australian , Nor@@ rie May @-@ Wel@@ by , became the world &apos;s first recognized &quot; gen@@ der@@ less &quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot; un@@ specified &quot; gender status for life .
German pas@@ sports will have a third desig@@ nation other than M or F -- X , for inter@@ sex , according to the Inter@@ ior Ministry .
in neighbor@@ ing France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on France 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of French law@@ makers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for &quot; gender theory &quot; to be withdrawn from school text@@ books .
the U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law , writing that &quot; as the world is being dra@@ gged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , we reverse two more pillars of civili@@ zation . &quot;
one Mar@@ y@@ land mother of a new@@ born also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see bab@@ ies assigned gender at birth .
&quot; par@@ enting is stres@@ s@@ ful enough without extra limitations , especially if you don &apos;t know the gender of your child , &quot; she told the par@@ enting website .
children need stability and certainty .
historically , children born with both male and female gen@@ itali@@ a were called her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes , named for the hand@@ some Greek go@@ d who had dual sexu@@ ality .
and as little as a decade ago , the medical community thought of gender as a s@@ late that could be er@@ ased and then re@@ drawn .
but now , many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors can sometimes get it wrong , not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assign@@ ment when they grow up .
&quot; back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a &apos; psy@@ chiat@@ ric emergency , &apos; &quot; said Dre@@ scher .
when these kids were born , you didn &apos;t call the psy@@ chiat@@ r@@ ist , you called a sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous gen@@ itali@@ a was put forward by Dr. John Mon@@ ey at Joh@@ ns Hop@@ k@@ ins University , who held that gender was m@@ alle@@ able .
he co@@ ined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental cu@@ es -- how parents raised a child -- inter@@ acted with a child &apos;s genes and hormon@@ es to shape whether the person identified as male or female .
but in one 1966 case , known as &quot; John / Jo@@ an , &quot; his the@@ ories became controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is had been sever@@ ed in a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision to have the child fully ca@@ str@@ ated , removing his tes@@ tic@@ les , as well , and to raise him as a girl .
&quot; money presented the case as a successful case of transition , but it was not , &quot; said Dre@@ scher .
when the boy was around 15 , he transi@@ tioned back to a boy and married a woman .
but at 38 , he committed suicide .
Dre@@ scher said that now some doctors are still &quot; practic@@ ing that model . &quot;
but in the 1990s , with the adv@@ ent of the Internet , survi@@ vors of these gender sur@@ ger@@ ies have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
such was the case with J@@ im Bru@@ ce , a 36 @-@ year @-@ old writer from Mon@@ tana , who was born with X@@ Y male chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es but ambiguous gen@@ it@@ als .
doctors couldn &apos;t be sure if he had a large cli@@ tor@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced he could never live a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
so shortly after his birth in 1976 , Bru@@ ce &apos;s external organ and te@@ stes were sur@@ gically removed and he was raised as a girl .
he was given female hormon@@ es at age 12 .
&quot; I knew that I wasn &apos;t a girl , &quot; he told AB@@ C@@ New@@ s.@@ com.
I was un@@ happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at 18 , he was set for a v@@ ag@@ in@@ op@@ la@@ sty .
but de@@ pressed and knowing something was wrong , he demanded medical records .
what he found out was horri@@ fying .
I was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth -- and no one ever told me .
Bru@@ ce was born with a DS@@ D that prevented his body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to properly develop his gen@@ it@@ als .
after learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one shots and having his bre@@ asts removed .
surgery rendered him in@@ fer@@ tile .
today , he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project , trying to normali@@ ze perc@@ ep@@ tions of those who are inter@@ sex .
but Anne Tam@@ ar @-@ Mat@@ tis , executive director for California @-@ based legal group Ad@@ voc@@ ates for Inform@@ ed Cho@@ ice , wor@@ ries that the German law &quot; invites lab@@ eling and sti@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; a lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos; un@@ determined , &apos; &quot; she said .
we are afraid it will encourage intervention .
we think a better process is assign@@ ing male or female sex , then waiting .
but we haven &apos;t seen how the law will play out , so all we can do is spec@@ ulate .
Tam@@ ar @-@ Mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender , &quot; she said .
German law is about assign@@ ing it at birth .
that is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point .
when they are grown , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
but Dr. Ar@@ l@@ ene Bar@@ atz , a Pit@@ ts@@ burgh breast radi@@ ologist who has a daughter with a dis@@ order of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group , said the German law will &quot; em@@ power &quot; both parents and children .
Bar@@ atz &apos;s daughter K@@ atie was born with male chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a DS@@ D called complete and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensitivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
because her and@@ ro@@ gen rec@@ ept@@ ors are f@@ aul@@ ty , K@@ atie developed female characteristics .
she has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us or o@@ varies .
now at 29 , K@@ atie is married and at the University of P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , a resident in child psy@@ chiat@@ ry .
though she is in@@ fer@@ tile , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gest@@ ational sur@@ ro@@ g@@ acy .
&quot; the law gives parents some space not to have to r@@ ush into making decisions themselves , &quot; said Bar@@ atz .
it gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female . &apos;
this way , you are OK -- raise the child , love the child .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun .
we don &apos;t have to r@@ ush into surgery that is irre@@ ver@@ sible .
&quot; it brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxi@@ ety that motiv@@ ates parents because they don &apos;t feel they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
ultimately , the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
it em@@ powers children to make the decision for themselves .
unknown attack@@ ers in@@ j@@ ure girl with shots fi@@ red from car
unknown attack@@ ers have injured a twelve @-@ year @-@ old girl in Sax@@ ony @-@ An@@ halt when fir@@ ing shots from a car .
the as@@ sail@@ ants fi@@ red on a group of children on Thursday evening in G@@ enth@@ in , presum@@ ably with an air gun .
this was announced by the police in Burg .
the girl suffered minor injury to her left cal@@ f .
rescue workers took the girl to the hospital .
the shots came from a small car , which dro@@ ve past a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the as@@ sail@@ ants also fi@@ red shots at a bus stop .
a pan@@ e of glass was sh@@ attered .
they then dro@@ ve away .
the Criminal Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ation Department is investig@@ ating the matter , it was stated on Friday .
thus far , the K@@ emp@@ ten Police Department can look back on a calm H@@ allo@@ ween night .
the authorities were only called out twice to deal with children thro@@ wing eggs against houses .
because the home owners realised this immediately , the egg rem@@ n@@ ants could be cleaned off at once , meaning that no material damage occurred .
furthermore , in the town centre area , while a few fire@@ works were set off , no material damage was caused here either .
the residents of the B@@ isch@@ of @-@ Fre@@ und@@ or@@ fer @-@ Weg reported that a car was wra@@ pped in toilet paper and its wheel tri@@ ms stol@@ en .
however , the man found all his wheel tri@@ ms nearby prior to the police arriving , on account of which no further police involvement was required .
living with a future @-@ oriented perspective
if truth be told , Wal@@ trau@@ d R@@ ies , lives a dre@@ am@@ y life .
her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in Stuttgart , with plenty of gre@@ enery , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
she is only a few minutes from the city centre using public transport .
&quot; hopefully you aren &apos;t afraid of spi@@ ders ? &quot; asks Wal@@ trau@@ d R@@ ies , pointing out a large spi@@ der on the door frame .
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now .
but you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart .
however , the reason for the desire to move is not ar@@ ach@@ no@@ pho@@ bia , but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their house , and inside their home in their old age , she explained .
furthermore : since under@@ going a men@@ is@@ cus operation , the lady , in her mid @-@ fif@@ ties , has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability .
only recently , she released a book on the subject of &quot; Li@@ ving happi@@ ly in old age - W@@ hi@@ ch type of property is the best for me ? . &quot;
&quot; our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn &apos;t work in old age , &quot; she begins to re@@ count .
when she moved to the ma@@ ison@@ ette with her husband 20 years ago , it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings .
now , in her mid @-@ fif@@ ties , Wal@@ trau@@ d R@@ ies has different thoughts about it .
however , she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
the majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible .
only other people get old , she says , sm@@ ir@@ king .
only when the psychological stra@@ in becomes severe do people give it consideration .
&quot; but at this stage it can be too late , &quot; said R@@ ies .
in her book , the interior decor@@ ator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age .
&quot; however , which type of residence you choose is always a personal decision , &quot; she explains .
there is no solution to over@@ coming old age .
even if you can afford to spend your retirement in Tuscany or Brit@@ t@@ any , you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration .
and : &apos; without a sound knowledge of the local language , you can even become lon@@ ely when living the dol@@ ce v@@ ita , &apos; added the author , providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad .
her models include classic care models , alternative living arrangements and the often @-@ mentioned pension@@ ers &apos; living community .
in old age everyone has their qu@@ ir@@ ks and ti@@ cks .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ wever , this type of residential community would not be for me , &apos; she comm@@ ented with a w@@ ink .
definitely nothing like student accommodation with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&apos;@@ in old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to , &apos; said R@@ ies .
however , the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pension@@ ers &apos; residential community can work .
however , it must operate differently to the classic student di@@ gs .
and sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet , &apos; she believes .
with this opinion she is at least not alone in the State Capital .
the experience of Ther@@ esa RÃ¼@@ tten , head of the citizen &apos;s Life in Old Age service in the State Capital , is also that &apos; the majority of old people in Stuttgart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible &apos; .
her agency agency advis@@ es people on the topic of &apos; growing old &apos; .
therefore the experience of the Stiftung War@@ ent@@ est consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept in@@ conveni@@ ences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment .
nowadays there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barrier @-@ free .
R@@ ies recommends that all those working on the age @-@ appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in @-@ depth information and don &apos;t simply use the first tra@@ des@@ man that comes along .
nowadays there are specialists in renovation to suit the needs of the elderly .
even in the case of rental apartments some land@@ l@@ ords can have this work carried out , even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat , clarified the interior designer .
however , it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age @-@ appropriate and therefore barrier @-@ free , even if it is as beautiful as ever .
Wal@@ trau@@ d R@@ ies had to go through this experience herself .
you could of course install a sta@@ ir lift inside the apartment , but the co@@ b@@ bled path up to the door of the apartment , featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ce .
she will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband .
she is more afraid of the move than of the spi@@ der on her front door .
the USA still want to pro@@ secu@@ te Snow@@ den
the USA have not changed their position regarding the former US Secre@@ t Service employee Edward Snow@@ den .
he is still accused of passing on secret information without authorisation .
he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the USA , said the spo@@ kes@@ person for the US Foreign Office , Jen@@ ni@@ fer P@@ sa@@ ki , in Washington .
even the most recent statements from Snow@@ den will not change this fact .
following a recent meeting with Snow@@ den in Moscow , German Green Party politician Hans @-@ Christian Str@@ Ã¶@@ bel@@ e appe@@ aled to the USA not to continue to threaten him with pro@@ secution .
P@@ sa@@ ki emphasised that Str@@ Ã¶@@ bel@@ e &apos;s comments were the views of a parliament@@ arian , and not those of a German government member .
secret Service whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , Edward Snow@@ den is , in principle , willing to hold a discussion with the German authorities .
however , he first wishes for his situation to be clarified .
this was made clear by the former N@@ SA employee , currently sought by the USA , in an open letter that Green Party politician Hans @-@ Christian Str@@ Ã¶@@ bel@@ e made public on Friday following a meeting with Snow@@ den , and passed on to the Federal Government , the Federal Parliament and the Federal Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor General .
the letter was pur@@ ported to have been wor@@ ded as follows :
to whom it may concern ,
I have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveillance .
I am Edward Joseph Snow@@ den , formerly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the United States National Security Agency , and Def@@ ense Intelli@@ gence Agency .
in the course of my service to these organizations , I believe I witnessed system@@ ic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act .
as a result of reporting these concerns , I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution that forced me from my family and home .
I am currently living in ex@@ ile under a grant of temporary asylum in the Russian Federation in accordance with international law .
I am hear@@ tened by the response to my act of political expression , in both the United States and beyond .
citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of per@@ va@@ sive surveillance to be a public service .
these sp@@ ying revel@@ ations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly conc@@ e@@ aled abuses of the public trust .
the benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mitig@@ ated .
though the outcome of my efforts has been demon@@ stra@@ bly positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ec@@ tion , and seeks to crimin@@ alize political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence .
however , speaking the truth is not a crime .
I am confident that with the support of the international community , the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behaviour .
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved , I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of facts regarding reports in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authentic@@ ity of documents , as appropriate and in accordance with the law .
I look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved , and thank you for your efforts in uph@@ ol@@ ding the international laws that protect us all .

a kinder@@ garten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands , &quot; said Winter@@ lingen &apos;s Mayor Michael Ma@@ ier .
the local authorities have sold the former Kinder@@ garten on Gar@@ ten@@ straÃe to a private buyer .
the Town Council con@@ s@@ ented to the sale in its most recent meeting , during the part of the meeting that was not open to the public .
the building changed hands for an &quot; appropriate &quot; price .
&quot; the local authorities are satisfied , &quot; emphasised Ma@@ ier .
EUR 100@@ ,000 have been added to the local budget .
it is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former Kinder@@ garten .
the Mayor considers it the right decision that Winter@@ lingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter , and thus will no longer have to pay for the up@@ keep of the building , such as heating it , ten@@ ding to the garden and cle@@ aring the pav@@ ement .
&quot; this expense has now been off@@ loaded , &quot; Ma@@ ier was glad to say .

report : Obama campaign considered dumping Bi@@ den for Hil@@ l@@ ary Clinton
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advis@@ ers secre@@ tly considered replacing Vice President Jo@@ e Bi@@ den with Hil@@ l@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 ticket , according to the New York Times .
the revel@@ ation is the most notable bom@@ b@@ shell from Mark Hal@@ per@@ in and John Hei@@ le@@ mann &apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tom@@ e , &quot; Double D@@ own : game Change 2012 . &quot;
the Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President &apos;s top ai@@ des conducted &quot; extensive group @-@ sessions and poll@@ ing in late 2011 &quot; to gau@@ ge whether the dumping Bi@@ den could help bol@@ ster Obama &apos;s wan@@ ing re @-@ election hopes .
according to the Times &apos; national political correspon@@ dent Jon@@ athan Martin , the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House , namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Dal@@ ey , to measure what effect sw@@ apping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the po@@ lls .
the potential switch was a closely gu@@ arded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the O@@ val Office .
only half a do@@ zen of the President &apos;s closest advis@@ ers -- including Dal@@ ey , former Obama campaign chief J@@ im Mes@@ sin@@ a , and former White House senior advis@@ ers David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David Pl@@ ou@@ ffe -- knew the change was under consideration .
&quot; double D@@ own &quot; claims Dal@@ ey spe@@ ar@@ headed the effort to replace Bi@@ den , despite their &quot; close personal rap@@ port , &quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn &apos;t &quot; materi@@ ally improve Obama &apos;s odds . &quot;
in an interview with Martin , Dal@@ ey confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Bi@@ den with Clinton .
&quot; I was vocal about looking into a whole b@@ unch of things , and this was one of them , &quot; Dal@@ ey told the paper .
you have to remember , at that point the President was in aw@@ ful shape , so we were like , &quot; Holy Christ , what do we do ? &quot;
while Dal@@ ey characterized the research as &quot; due di@@ li@@ gence , &quot; Martin told CN@@ N &apos;s Ander@@ son Co@@ oper that the re @-@ election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay divi@@ den@@ ds at the po@@ lls .
&quot; campaigns don &apos;t spend the kind of money on poll@@ ing and focus groups unless they &apos;re seriously considering something , &quot; Martin said on AC@@ 360 .
it &apos;s unclear , however , whether Obama knew his team was exploring the s@@ wap .
Martin told CN@@ N that he asked Dal@@ ey whether his then @-@ bo@@ ss knew about the potential sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le .
while Dal@@ ey said he doesn &apos;t think the President &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; Obama knew .
Martin added that &quot; Double D@@ own &quot; does not definiti@@ vely answer whether the political prob@@ ing reached Obama &apos;s desk .
Co@@ oper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Bi@@ den from the ticket .
&quot; possibly , &quot; Martin rep@@ lied .
what happens with my e @-@ mail when in transit ?
e @-@ mail is short for electronic mail .
are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspon@@ dence , similar to that of the traditional postal service , implemented into the design of this Internet @-@ based service ?
when designing the early Internet services , the focus lay on making communication possible .
thus , when developing the underlying technical protocols , no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the inter@@ c@@ eption @-@ proof exchange of mail .
for this reason , a traditional email is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
when user &quot; Anna &quot; sends an email to &quot; B@@ enn@@ i , &quot; are the pair &apos;s computers then directly connected ?
Anna &apos;s email program or browser first sends the mail to her service provider &apos;s mail server .
if she has a G@@ mail account , for example , this would be Google .
this mail server sends the content to the provider that B@@ enn@@ i uses .
en route , the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the Internet .
B@@ enn@@ i can then call up the content from his provider .
are traditional e @-@ mails read by third parties on their journey through the net ?
the majority of e @-@ mails are read several times by software robots en route to the recipient .
checks are generally carried out by the sender &apos;s provider as to whether the mail contains mal@@ ware as an attach@@ ment .
a virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems .
in addition , the providers check whether it is nu@@ is@@ ance or un@@ wanted spam mail , which are deleted immediately or at least sor@@ ted into a spam folder .
do the robots have other tasks ?
in the case of systems such as G@@ mail , the robots also identify the information that Google requires for displaying context @-@ based advertising .
if Anna and B@@ enn@@ i communicate about their upcoming holiday tra@@ vels via G@@ mail , Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers .
do unknown individuals also read the e @-@ mails ?
the prob@@ ability of un@@ authorised persons reading a mail is extremely low .
however , theore@@ tically , it is possible .
within companies , administr@@ ators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent .
law enforcement authorities and Secre@@ t Services also have legal authorisation to inter@@ c@@ ept or take note of e @-@ mails .
this may include potential illegal sp@@ ying activities .
is it possible to protect e @-@ mails against being read ?
with an encryption using the Open@@ P@@ GP standard , an e @-@ mail can be effectively protected against being read .
with great technical effort , it is also possible to conc@@ eal the met@@ ad@@ ata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communic@@ ating with whom .
how important are Yahoo and Google within the e @-@ mail market in Germany ?
according to a study conducted by Con@@ vi@@ os Consulting in August 2013 , among the main mail services in private use , Yahoo and Google play only a minor role .
while the number of Yahoo Mail accounts has fallen recently , Google &apos;s G@@ mail managed to grow considerably .
mother bu@@ ried in sh@@ allow forest grave and pension stol@@ en
when his elderly mother died , a man from Wol@@ fs@@ burg de@@ vised a plan .
he bu@@ ried the dec@@ e@@ ased in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allow@@ ance .
according to police investigations , a 67 @-@ year @-@ old Wol@@ fs@@ burg resident bu@@ ried his dead mother in the woods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allow@@ ance .
he first covered up the death of the 89 @-@ year @-@ old and then po@@ ck@@ eted the money for more than a year and a half .
the 67 @-@ year @-@ old must now face charges of fraud , said a spo@@ kes@@ person on Friday .
according to the statement , the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near Hel@@ m@@ st@@ edt .
the man was already under suspicion back in May : at that time the fact that medic@@ ations for his care @-@ reli@@ ant mother were no longer required drew suspicion .
the pension@@ er told investig@@ ators that his mother had trav@@ elled to Spain .
the officials found this strange and so continued to investigate .
it was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had c@@ ared for her in her final days .
the 67 @-@ year @-@ old finally acknowledged the death of his mother .
according to police , an au@@ top@@ sy showed no evidence of any capital off@@ ence .
fan@@ cy a g@@ low @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ice cream ?
a British entrepren@@ eur has created the world &apos;s first g@@ low @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ice cream - using j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
Char@@ lie Francis has har@@ ness@@ ed the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of the marine animal to develop the lum@@ ines@@ cent snack .
he came up with the idea after reading a research paper on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced scientists in China to chem@@ ically recre@@ ate the glo@@ wing protein .
the ice cream re@@ acts with the e@@ ater &apos;s tongue - raising the p@@ H level in the protein and making it g@@ low .
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it re@@ acts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you li@@ ck , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
Char@@ lie , founder of the &quot; L@@ ick Me I &apos;m Deli@@ cious &quot; ice cream company , said : &quot; it is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so Â£ 200 gets you about 2@@ g of the stuff . &quot;
the protein we are using in the ice cream re@@ acts with your tongue at neutral p@@ H .
so as your mouth war@@ ms up the protein it will raise the p@@ H level and the ice cream will g@@ low .
we have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over H@@ allo@@ ween because it gives that wonderful g@@ low effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish lum@@ ines@@ c@@ ence is four times more expensive than gold .
so each sco@@ op costs me around Â£ 140 .
it tastes pretty good though .
Char@@ lie &apos;s experimental company , based in Bristol , is fam@@ ed for its unusual flav@@ ours including beer , cheese , beef and gold lea@@ f .
but his next creation is set to be even more ambitious .
he said : &quot; I really want to develop an inv@@ isi@@ ble ice cream . &quot;
it is inher@@ ently impossible because of the refra@@ ction caused by the ice cryst@@ als which make up the ice cream , but I reck@@ on we will find a way of doing it .
the ice cream har@@ nesses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , syn@@ thes@@ ized by Chinese scientists
after six match days , T@@ SV Mor@@ sum are yet to score a single point in the Hand@@ ball Association League .
and of all possible times , In@@ go E@@ h@@ ler &apos;s team has a der@@ by match against T@@ SV Da@@ ver@@ den tomorrow , which celebrated their first victory last week .
the season begins af@@ res@@ h for us with this match .
&quot; I hope that we finally have our heads clear , &quot; comm@@ ented E@@ hl@@ ers , remaining cau@@ ti@@ ously optimistic .
for this match he finally has his complete squ@@ ad available , with the exception of H@@ end@@ ri@@ ck Blo@@ h@@ me who is out with long @-@ term injury .
like us , Da@@ ver@@ den place emphasis on high temp@@ o play .
for this reason , we must keep our errors to a minimum .
however , the top priority is to improve our cover play , which has recently left much to be desired .
Da@@ ver@@ den &apos;s coach Thomas Pan@@ itz comes across as much more relaxed following his team &apos;s first victory of the season against Nord@@ horn .
the match was of course a indication of what we are capable of .
however , it by no means makes us favour@@ ites , as anything can happen in the der@@ by .
nonetheless , Pan@@ itz is now looking to come up with the goods in Mor@@ sum and thus start a winning stre@@ ak .
Jan @-@ Mal@@ te J@@ od@@ at will not be playing .
thus , A @-@ Youth player J@@ oo@@ st Wind@@ Ã@@ u@@ Ã , who plays an active part for A @-@ Youth League team HC Bremen , will be celebrating his season dÃ©@@ but .
anyone who is not fi@@ red up for a game like this should stay at home .
H@@ allo@@ ween 2013 : by the Num@@ bers
when I was little , H@@ allo@@ ween was magical .
my sister and I were allowed to eat cand@@ y , stay up late and play dress @-@ up for the neighborhood .
nowadays , I &apos;ve become more of a sc@@ ro@@ o@@ ge .
I haven &apos;t signed up for the past two years to give out cand@@ y in my apartment and probably won &apos;t this year .
but stat@@ s show that I &apos;m a black sheep when it comes to H@@ allo@@ ween .
the majority of Americans - 15@@ 8 million of them in fact - will be celebrating H@@ allo@@ ween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on cand@@ y , co@@ stum@@ es and decor@@ ations , according to the National Ret@@ ail Federation .
one thing I do look forward to every H@@ allo@@ ween are the trends .
co@@ stum@@ es are expected to account for $ 1.2 billion dollars out of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
this year , sexy in@@ anim@@ ate objects are all the rage .
women don &apos;t have to be sexy professionals anymore ; they can also be sexy foods like pi@@ zza , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
as for men , I expect we will be seeing a lot of z@@ om@@ bies , thanks to The Wal@@ king De@@ ad and I &apos;ll bet the D@@ af@@ t Pun@@ k space men will make it into our Inst@@ agra@@ m feeds this year .
according to Google , the highest search@@ ed co@@ stum@@ es are z@@ om@@ bies , Bat@@ man , pir@@ ates and wit@@ ches .
I gu@@ ess there &apos;s nothing wrong with going traditional .
we dres@@ sed our dogs up last year and to my amaz@@ ement we were not alone .
in fact , Americans will spend $ 3@@ 30 million on pet co@@ stum@@ es this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
that &apos;s a lot of ir@@ onic Hot@@ dog dogs .
when it comes to cand@@ y , we don &apos;t scre@@ w around .
Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion on it this year , according to The Ni@@ el@@ sen Company .
that &apos;s around 600 million po@@ unds worth of Her@@ sh@@ ey bars , l@@ ol@@ li@@ po@@ ps , Mil@@ k du@@ ds , T@@ wi@@ zz@@ lers and Clar@@ k Bars .
that &apos;s great news for the 41 million tri@@ ck @-@ or @-@ Tre@@ aters set to take over our neighbor@@ hoods , according to the U.S. Commerce Department .
in fact , we will buy and , who are we ki@@ dding , consu@@ me 90 million po@@ unds of chocolate during H@@ allo@@ ween .
the one thing we don &apos;t want to consu@@ me , cand@@ y cor@@ n ; and yet nearly 35 million po@@ unds of it are sold around H@@ allo@@ ween , according to the National Con@@ fec@@ tion@@ ers Association .
that &apos;s about 9 billion individual k@@ ern@@ els of cor@@ n .
it &apos;s a myst@@ ery I have yet to solve .
nothing is more qu@@ int@@ essentially H@@ allo@@ ween than ha@@ un@@ ted houses .
they have the best names , like &quot; Terror Behin@@ d the W@@ alls &quot; ( which , by the way is in an actual prison ) , &quot; Ho@@ w@@ l @-@ O @-@ Scre@@ am &quot; and &quot; The House of Sho@@ ck . &quot;
in fact , there are 1,@@ 200 officially san@@ c@@ tioned ha@@ un@@ ted houses in the United States generating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to America ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes those a@@ wes@@ ome photos of you mid @-@ pe@@ eing your pan@@ ts that your friend puts on Facebook and you can &apos;t take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot; nice face . &quot;
finally , let &apos;s talk pum@@ p@@ k@@ ins .
Char@@ lie Brown introduced us to The Great Pum@@ p@@ kin when we were kids , and car@@ ving a jack @-@ o @-@ lan@@ tern is like decor@@ ating a Christmas tree - it &apos;s something we &apos;ve done since we were little .
lucky for us , the &quot; baby in a pum@@ p@@ kin trend &quot; started only last year thanks to P@@ interest , so most of us grew up car@@ ving these g@@ our@@ ds not sitting in them .
this year , Americans will spend around $ 10@@ 6 million on pum@@ p@@ k@@ ins , according to the U.S. C@@ en@@ sus Bureau .
the jack @-@ o @-@ lan@@ tern slowly wi@@ ther@@ ing on your front por@@ ch probably came from Il@@ lin@@ ois , which grew 5@@ 42 million po@@ unds of pum@@ p@@ kin this year .
if you &apos;re looking for extra credit , call T@@ im and Sus@@ an Ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in Nap@@ a , Cali@@ f . , and try to car@@ ve up their 2,@@ 0@@ 32 po@@ und pum@@ p@@ kin .
House fire in Hel@@ m@@ bre@@ chts : rescue services re@@ trie@@ ve char@@ red body
the fire service were called out to Hel@@ m@@ bre@@ chts late on Thursday evening .
a three @-@ bedroom house in the district of Hof cat@@ ches fire during the night .
rescue workers re@@ trie@@ ve a char@@ red body from the house .
during a fire in Hel@@ m@@ bre@@ chts , rescue services found a char@@ red body in a three @-@ bedroom house .
whether this person was living in the house is as yet unclear , said a police spo@@ kes@@ person in Bay@@ re@@ uth .
late on Thursday evening , fire broke out on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire service arrived , the fl@@ ames were already bur@@ sting out of a window .
rescue workers entered the premises and found the body in a bedroom .
this and another bedroom were completely bur@@ nt out .
the entire ground floor suffered damage .
there were no other residents at home during the fire , continued the police spo@@ kes@@ person .
for the time being , the house is no longer hab@@ itable .
the precise cause of the fire was initially unclear .
Germany &apos;s largest national church has launched a campaign advertising the minister &apos;s position .
this comes at the same time as a possible shortage of ministers : the Prote@@ stant Lu@@ ther@@ an Regional Church of Han@@ over calcul@@ ates that , as things stand , the current number of around 1,@@ 800 past@@ ors will be hal@@ ved by 2030 .
for the young people of today , the career is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Past@@ or Ma@@ this Bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in a conversation with the Prote@@ stant Press Service .
it is attractive to be able to determine your own daily working routine .
with Bur@@ fi@@ en , the regional church has for first time commissioned a minister to work full time , endeav@@ ouring to insp@@ ire young people to study the@@ ology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study the@@ ology after their Ab@@ it@@ ur exam@@ inations ( equivalent to A levels ) .
Bur@@ fi@@ en puts this down to the process of se@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation : &quot; God &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud . &quot;
the job is characterised by great freedom and variety .
I am the master of my own schedule and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me .
as past@@ oral workers , ministers can be close to people .
they earn as much as teachers and can make a good living .
of course wages are higher within the private sector , but on the other hand , the@@ ologi@@ ans have a secure employer .
this would suit the young people of today , as it is not just about your career , but about having a meaningful job as well .
according to information from the Regional Church , which covers three quarters of Lo@@ wer Sax@@ ony , around 60 past@@ ors reti@@ re every year .

fire cre@@ ws called to rescue lost pu@@ ppy after she got stuck 50@@ ft above the ground on prec@@ arious le@@ dge in a quar@@ ry
Co@@ cker sp@@ ani@@ el Ru@@ by had run off after she was in a minor road crash
she was spot@@ ted three days later by a dog wal@@ ker tra@@ pped in the quar@@ ry
fire@@ figh@@ ters ab@@ sei@@ l down cli@@ ff face to plu@@ ck the dog from certain death
a pu@@ ppy had a lucky escape after fire cre@@ ws were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50@@ ft up on a prec@@ arious cli@@ ff le@@ dge .
nine month @-@ old co@@ cker sp@@ ani@@ el Ru@@ by had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before being res@@ cu@@ ed from a quar@@ ry on Wednesday .
her owners Scott Al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend Be@@ cky Hall , 20 , were at Fla@@ pp@@ it Quar@@ ry in Den@@ hol@@ me , West Yor@@ k@@ shire , to be re@@ united with Ru@@ by and have than@@ ked West Yor@@ k@@ shire Fire and Res@@ cue Service .
they had search@@ ed fran@@ tically for their missing dog and posted appe@@ als on social networking sites after she had ran into the quar@@ ry following the minor accident .
at around 2.@@ 15@@ pm on Wednesday , an eag@@ le @-@ e@@ yed dog wal@@ ker spot@@ ted Ru@@ by on the le@@ dge in the quar@@ ry , str@@ anded 50@@ ft up .
a Technical Res@@ cue Team from Cle@@ ck@@ he@@ aton Fire Station rus@@ hed to the scene and ab@@ sei@@ led down to rescue Ru@@ by and used a pet tube to transport her up the cli@@ ff .
specialist Technical Res@@ cue Officer An@@ dy C@@ lay@@ ton said : &apos; she was in a prec@@ arious situation .
she was right in the middle of the cli@@ ff face - 50@@ ft from the top and bottom .
she did not move a mus@@ cle during the rescue - she was frozen solid .
but she is fine now .
she was eating bis@@ cu@@ its afterwards .
this was a very unusual call @-@ out .
the fact that the dog was spot@@ ted is un@@ belie@@ vable .
specialist Technical Res@@ cue Officer Peter L@@ au said : &quot; Ru@@ by had a very lucky escape . &quot;
the potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was taken to the v@@ ets for a check @-@ up and was found to be fine other than exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion .
miss Hall , from H@@ ali@@ fax , West Yor@@ k@@ shire , said : &quot; watching the rescue was terri@@ fying . &quot;
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place .
it was amazing to get her back in our arms .
the vet said that if she became too exhau@@ sted and collap@@ sed she would probably have fallen .
the fire@@ figh@@ ters were amazing .
it was really dar@@ ing what they did .
we are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ eigh@@ ley , added : &quot; we were sc@@ ared that she might fall but she stayed there . &quot;
the fire@@ figh@@ ters were brilliant .
I just can &apos;t believe where she was .

George Ker@@ ev@@ an : Europe break @-@ up gives Sc@@ ots choice
another day , another independence sc@@ are story .
this time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe @-@ wide free @-@ travel zone as a condition of EU membership .
cue stories about passport controls at Ber@@ wick and a bar@@ bed wire border along H@@ ad@@ rian &apos;s Wall .
true , the Stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of fre@@ er movement with the rest of Europe , though - predict@@ ably - that did not figure in the head@@ lines .
nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time ben@@ ding their formal rules if it suits them .
since Scotland isn &apos;t in the Schengen area now , continued non @-@ compliance would be a cheap conc@@ ession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Sc@@ ots .
so , a non @-@ story , then .
and one that is so long in the to@@ oth it has become fossi@@ li@@ sed : I first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; can@@ ard at least 40 years ago .
yet there is an interesting point lost in this ret@@ elling of a wh@@ is@@ ker@@ y old tale .
why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe &apos;s bi@@ dding , anyway ?
why trade London &apos;s yo@@ ke for that of Brussels , especially now ?
here is the real European news : the great , post @-@ war plan to unite Europe has finally st@@ alled .
with the euro crisis , Project Europe is officially dead .
across the EU , parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU , or to scra@@ pping the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
even in Germany , the Euro@@ scep@@ tic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to gra@@ b nearly five million votes in September &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively kno@@ cking the Free Democrats ( equivalent to our own Li@@ b D@@ ems ) out of the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
however , the current economic crisis has proved a water@@ shed .
the austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , coupled with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et imposed on national economies through adher@@ ence to the common currency , has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece .
rather , the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German expor@@ ters - something German politicians want to keep .
without the possibility of domestic currency de@@ valuation , southern Europe finds itself with a built @-@ in productivity disadvantage vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis Germany .
the only rec@@ ourse is to s@@ lash wages and public spending - sp@@ ur@@ red on by Berlin .
beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity mal@@ a@@ ise .
as a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsi@@ dis@@ ing French and German energy firms at the consumer &apos;s expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the United States .
that is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost disadvantage , as we &apos;ve already seen at Gran@@ gem@@ outh .
all the wage free@@ zes in the world won &apos;t stop the European pet@@ ro@@ chemicals industry being ham@@ mer@@ ed by cheap US sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , revol@@ t is bre@@ wing , especially in France , once the EU &apos;s main che@@ er@@ leader .
after the war , the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check , and to give Paris equal bil@@ ling in the world with Washington .
but Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe , leaving the batter@@ ed French economy struggling .
result : marine Le Pen &apos;s right @-@ wing , anti @-@ EU National Front has just won a crucial by @-@ election , kno@@ cking the ruling Socialists into third place .
the Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can &apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left .
what is Le Pen doing with her new@@ found popularity among the French white , working class ?
she wants to use next year &apos;s EU elections to create an anti @-@ EU , anti @-@ common currency blo@@ c across the European Parliament .
if , as is very possible , anti @-@ EU parties do well in these elections , such a blo@@ c could domin@@ ate the European Parliament for the first time .
here &apos;s my point : some@@ time soon growing anti @-@ EU and anti @-@ common currency feeling in Europe will co@@ al@@ es@@ ce to kill the euro .
the EU won &apos;t disappear , but it will rever@@ t to something more like the loose &quot; Europe of the ( So@@ ver@@ eign ) Nations &quot; favoured by General de Gaulle .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revi@@ ve their own currencies .
I expect the UK will distance itself from this project , hoping to cosy up to the US .
however , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold .
where does this leave Scotland ?
we can choose to be a region of ( essentially ) Little England .
or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off .
I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a loo@@ ser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency .
co @-@ operation with other like @-@ minded countries will be easier in a non @-@ federal Europe of the Nations .
otherwise we should consider em@@ ul@@ ating Norway and re@@ taining our economic independence .
the SN@@ P government in Scotland is - remark@@ ab@@ ly@@ -- the most successful anti @-@ austerity political movement in Europe , having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by Labour &apos;s chan@@ cellor Ali@@ sta@@ ir Dar@@ ling and the subsequent T@@ ory @-@ Li@@ b D@@ em coalition .
it would be ridicul@@ ous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
early pu@@ ber@@ ty : growing older sooner
African @-@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than their white counter@@ parts , research shows .
physical changes don &apos;t mean pu@@ ber@@ ty is im@@ min@@ ent
there &apos;s no evidence that hormon@@ es or other chemicals are to blame
experts think the o@@ bes@@ ity epide@@ mic might be one trigger of early pu@@ ber@@ ty
the trend toward early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pron@@ ounced with boys
former CN@@ N correspon@@ dent P@@ at Eth@@ eri@@ dge is a journalist speciali@@ zing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
should a mother be al@@ armed if her daughter begins to s@@ pro@@ ut breast bu@@ ds and pu@@ bic hair at 7 or 8 ?
at the annual conference of the American Academy of P@@ edi@@ at@@ rics this week in Or@@ land@@ o , Florida , pedi@@ at@@ ric endo@@ c@@ rin@@ ologist Dr. Paul Kap@@ lo@@ witz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm .
&quot; I spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents -- usually , this does not signal a rapid pro@@ gression into full pu@@ ber@@ ty , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ witz .
obvious signs of development , such as bud@@ ding bre@@ asts , pu@@ bic and under@@ arm hair and body od@@ or are appearing sooner in girls .
but there has been only a slight shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che ( the first period ) over the past four decades .
in the United States , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , down from 12.@@ 75 in 1970 .
&quot; once bre@@ asts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before men@@ ar@@ che , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ witz , also author of &quot; E@@ arly pu@@ ber@@ ty in Gir@@ ls : the Es@@ sen@@ tial Guide to Cop@@ ing with This Common Problem . &quot;
time is the most accurate test of how pu@@ ber@@ ty is going to progress .
there is debate about what constitutes the actual on@@ set of pu@@ ber@@ ty , but it is considered &quot; pre@@ co@@ cious &quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth sp@@ urt before age 8 .
in most cases , the process will slow down or st@@ all -- something a pedi@@ atri@@ cian can monitor closely .
a more rapid pro@@ gression may warrant tests by an endo@@ c@@ rin@@ ologist to rule out serious problems such as tum@@ ors or c@@ yst@@ s .
there are treatments to delay early men@@ ses and ward off another consequence : premature aging of the b@@ ones that ultimately can lead to stun@@ ted growth and being short as an adult .
recommendations for drug or hor@@ m@@ one therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , rate of development , growth rate and emotional mat@@ urity .
psycho@@ social aspects are important , too .
Kap@@ lo@@ witz is cau@@ tious with medic@@ ation but acknowled@@ ges , &quot; sup@@ pressing pu@@ ber@@ ty may allevi@@ ate behavi@@ oral issues and girls &apos; feelings of being different from pe@@ ers . &quot;
the other big issue is understandable : parents simply don &apos;t want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters having periods .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ witz .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; rec@@ alls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10 .
even though there were signs and we had talked about men@@ stru@@ ation , she was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
she came home from school sc@@ ared and up@@ set to be the first among her friends .
there are lots of well @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed the@@ ories about the causes of pre@@ co@@ cious pu@@ ber@@ ty .
yet , there &apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hormon@@ es in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame .
boys - like girls - are hit@@ ting pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier .
Kap@@ lo@@ witz con@@ tends the prem@@ ise that holds the most weight is the epide@@ mic of o@@ bes@@ ity .
he helped conduct a 2001 study of 6@@ - to 9 @-@ year @-@ old girls that links body fat to the timing of pu@@ ber@@ ty .
other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country , African @-@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than their white counter@@ parts .
there are varying explanations .
globally , patterns of early pu@@ ber@@ ty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .
another con@@ und@@ rum : although boys are getting fac@@ ial and pu@@ bic hair at younger ages , the trend toward full @-@ blo@@ wn early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pron@@ ounced as it is with girls .
other doctors attending the A@@ AP conference reinforced the comple@@ xi@@ ties of the topic .
the appearance of ac@@ ne and pu@@ bic hair is common even in in@@ fan@@ ts and to@@ dd@@ lers .
&quot; we need to be careful about how we identify the true on@@ set of pu@@ ber@@ ty , &quot; said Dr. La@@ wr@@ ence Silver@@ man , a pedi@@ at@@ ric endo@@ c@@ rin@@ ologist at Gor@@ ye@@ b Children &apos;s Hospital in Mor@@ rist@@ own , New Jersey .
parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pedi@@ atri@@ cian about how to talk with their child .
&quot; it may mean having a sooner @-@ than @-@ expected conversation , &quot; Kap@@ lo@@ witz advised .
if you remain calm , your child usually will respond well .
girls who b@@ los@@ som early need re@@ assurance that , even when it happens ahead of schedule , the process is a normal part of life .
jet makers feu@@ d over seat width with big orders at stake
a row has fla@@ red up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist @-@ class seats on long @-@ distance flights , setting the tone for a bitter confron@@ tation at this month &apos;s Dubai Air@@ show .
the dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long @-@ hau@@ l flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most cour@@ ted by airlines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest j@@ ets offered by Airbus S@@ AS and Boeing Co .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 in@@ ches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cab@@ ins , but its U.S. arch @-@ rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide .
the dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever @-@ larger versions of their twin @-@ eng@@ ined long @-@ distance aircraft , with potentially record orders expected at the November 17 @-@ 21 event .
how the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 ab@@ re@@ ast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini @-@ j@@ umb@@ o &quot; jet designs .
Boeing says its rev@@ amp@@ ed &quot; 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X &quot; will hold 4@@ 06 people based on economy seats more than 17 in@@ ches wide and set out 10 in each row .
Airbus says the competing version of its A3@@ 50 will carry 350 people in 18 @-@ inch @-@ wide economy seat laid out 9 ab@@ re@@ ast .
plane gi@@ ants often trade blo@@ ws on technical matters through advertising in the trade press .
now , Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X is expected to domin@@ ate with more than 100 orders .
it recently pre@@ viewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing finan@@ ci@@ ers a slide illustr@@ ating three people squ@@ ash@@ ed together at a restaurant , ti@@ tled &quot; W@@ ould You Acc@@ ept This ? &quot;
&quot; Boeing is proposing long @-@ distance flying in seats nar@@ ro@@ wer than regional tur@@ bo @-@ pro@@ ps , &quot; said Airbus sales chief John Le@@ ah@@ y .
as di@@ ets change , people get bigger but plane seating has not radi@@ cally changed .
between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 7@@ 47 j@@ umb@@ o defined modern long @-@ hau@@ l travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American 40@@ - to 49 @-@ year @-@ old male increased by 10 per cent , according to U.S. Health Department Data .
the wa@@ ist of the average 21st @-@ century American male is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 in@@ ches , according to U.S. health statistics .
Airbus says its rival is sti@@ cking to a seat concept from the 195@@ 0s , when the average gir@@ th of the newly ch@@ risten@@ ed &quot; jet set &quot; was nar@@ ro@@ wer .
Airbus says it has commissioned research suggest@@ ing an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
Boeing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fa@@ res and facilities .
it also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat .
&quot; it really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said Boeing cab@@ ins expert K@@ ent Cra@@ ver .
they don &apos;t want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them profitable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for fl@@ yers it is about more el@@ bow room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 700 @-@ billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the sc@@ ales of U.S. and European exports .
as Re@@ u@@ ters first reported in July , seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest j@@ ets .
both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin @-@ eng@@ ined long @-@ hau@@ l designs than the market leader in that segment , the 365 @-@ seat Boeing 7@@ 77 @-@ 300@@ ER .
Boeing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on compar@@ ing the 10 @-@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X with an original 9 @-@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 77 design .
the gain in unit costs is bl@@ un@@ ted compared with 10 @-@ ab@@ re@@ ast now in use .
&quot; the reason Boeing are doing this is to cra@@ m more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said Kev@@ in Ken@@ ist@@ on , head of passenger comfort at Europe &apos;s Airbus .
on the other hand , an@@ alyst@@ s say full 10 @-@ seat @-@ per @-@ row cab@@ ins for existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s suggest many passengers are voting for the den@@ ser layout , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fa@@ res .
&quot; eigh@@ teen in@@ ches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 7@@ 77 , &quot; said cabin interiors expert Mary Kir@@ by , founder and editor of the Run@@ way Gir@@ l Network .
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
globe @-@ tro@@ t@@ ting jet s@@ ellers even carry tape measures to check on competing lay@@ outs .
while bo@@ asting comfort , all buil@@ ders also offer j@@ ets with high @-@ density lay@@ outs for low @-@ cost airlines and regional travel .
Airbus offers a 10 @-@ ab@@ re@@ ast A3@@ 50 but says it has not yet sold it .
until recently , Airbus was stres@@ sing the need for more cabin custom@@ ization by offering wider ais@@ le seats on some of its j@@ ets .
without the support of the only other maker of large modern j@@ ets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly , but could di@@ stra@@ ct from a wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X sales .
new anti @-@ ni@@ cot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could take the pleasure out of smoking
scientists have developed an anti @-@ ni@@ cot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigare@@ tte .
a single dose of the vacc@@ ine was able to protect mi@@ ce against ni@@ cot@@ ine addi@@ ction for life .
further tests are needed before starting human trials , which would take several years , but Professor Ron@@ ald Cr@@ yst@@ al of Wei@@ ll Cor@@ nell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good .
&quot; we are very hope@@ ful that this kind of vacc@@ ine strategy can finally help the millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop , exhau@@ sting all the methods on the market today , but find their ni@@ cot@@ ine addi@@ ction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; Pro@@ f Cor@@ nell said .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been engine@@ ered to carry the genetic information to make anti @-@ ni@@ cot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects li@@ ver cells , which then start to make a steady stream of the anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hun@@ t down any ni@@ cot@@ ine molec@@ ules in the bloo@@ d@@ stream , neutrali@@ sing them before they reached the brain , preventing a smo@@ ker from getting a ni@@ cot@@ ine hit .
in tests , vacc@@ inated mi@@ ce who were subsequently given ni@@ cot@@ ine continued with their normal activity .
but mi@@ ce who had not been given the vacc@@ ine &quot; chil@@ led out , &quot; say the researchers , a sign that the ni@@ cot@@ ine had reached their bra@@ ins .
the experiments are described in the jour@@ nal Science Transl@@ ational Medi@@ cine .
previous tobacco vacc@@ ines failed because they contained anti@@ bodies .
the j@@ ab@@ s had to be given so frequently to keep anti@@ body levels t@@ opp@@ ed up that they proved expensive and im@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is likely to be far lower , because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body factories .
pro@@ f Cr@@ yst@@ al said that if a future human vacc@@ ine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were temp@@ ted to try a cigare@@ tte , preventing ni@@ cot@@ ine addi@@ ction .
but more likely it would be used by smo@@ kers to qu@@ it .
&quot; they will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the ni@@ cot@@ ine vacc@@ ine , and that can help them k@@ ick the hab@@ it , &quot; he said .
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed .
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies being influenced by O@@ bei@@ d
former N@@ S@@ W Labor minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di will be investigated by the state &apos;s corruption wat@@ ch@@ dog .
former N@@ S@@ W minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di has denied changing maritime le@@ ases policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ bei@@ d , who had hidden interests in three properties on government @-@ controlled land .
the In@@ dependent Commission Aga@@ inst Cor@@ ruption ( IC@@ AC ) on Friday wi@@ dened its inquiry into whether Mr O@@ bei@@ d lob@@ bi@@ ed several state ministers to have le@@ ases at Cir@@ cular Qu@@ ay , where the O@@ bei@@ ds owned two restaurants and a cafe , renewed without going to tender after their expi@@ ration in August 2005 .
it &apos;s now investig@@ ating alleg@@ ations Mr Tri@@ po@@ di knew of Mr O@@ bei@@ d &apos;s secret interest in the properties , after evidence given by Mr Tri@@ po@@ di &apos;s former dep@@ uty chief of staff , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ pole , on Thursday .
during years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the le@@ ases to go to public tender .
the les@@ sees were against this and also wanted longer terms .
in 2009 le@@ ases for the Cir@@ cular Qu@@ ay enterprises , which earned the O@@ bei@@ ds about $ 2.5 million annually , were renewed without going to public tender .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009 , was initially in favour of public ten@@ ders .
but he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr O@@ bei@@ d , who Mr Tri@@ po@@ di acknowledged was ur@@ ging a shift in government le@@ ase policy .
a phone trans@@ cript tabled in IC@@ AC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ bei@@ d , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Steve Dun@@ n , a senior bureau@@ cra@@ t who had come into the ports mini@@ stry after working under Mr O@@ bei@@ d in the fisheries department .
&quot; was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone convers@@ ations the development of the commercial le@@ ase policy , &quot; Assi@@ stant Commissioner Anth@@ ony W@@ heal@@ y asked Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&quot; no , &quot; Mr Tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .
I can &apos;t remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn &apos;t that .
definitely not between myself and Mr O@@ bei@@ d .
Israeli war@@ planes attack target inside Syria , official says
Israeli war@@ planes struck a target inside the Syrian port city of Lat@@ akia Thursday night , a senior administration official confirms to Fox News .
the official did not specify what the target was , but said there was at least one .
the Associ@@ ated Press reports the target was Russian @-@ made SA @-@ 125 missi@@ les .
at least twice earlier this year Israel launched air@@ strikes on ship@@ ments of missi@@ les inside Syria .
foreign workers on 4@@ 57 visas could under@@ go &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; test
a &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; test for foreign workers on 4@@ 57 visas is being considered by the government as it contem@@ plates expanding a cra@@ ck@@ down .
the test , if adopted , would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 45@@ 7@@ s being used to fill uns@@ killed positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia .
a government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Max@@ ine Mc@@ Ke@@ w sl@@ amm@@ ed the government &apos;s rhetoric about foreign workers , saying it could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbours .
&quot; loud declarations about &apos; foreigners getting to the back of the qu@@ eu@@ e &apos; and &apos; Aus@@ sie jobs first &apos; are a very un@@ pleasant thro@@ w@@ back to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market , &quot; she told the Australia India Institute today .
historically , that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw e@@ cho@@ es of that historic arti@@ fact , I wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
the discussion paper out@@ lines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immig@@ ration Minister Chris Bo@@ wen .
immigration Minister Br@@ end@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor , who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smu@@ ggling , has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remain@@ der under consideration .
if the &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrut@@ in@@ ised about &quot; whether the nom@@ ination is genuine in circumstances where the nom@@ ine@@ e is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsor@@ ing business . &quot;
businesses could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds .
meanwhile , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old Sri Lan@@ kan asylum seek@@ er died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week .
the man &apos;s di@@ str@@ au@@ ght nine @-@ year @-@ old son trav@@ elled to Australia with him and has been com@@ for@@ ted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult c@@ ous@@ in who was also on the vessel .
Australian authorities rus@@ hed the man to Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .
a study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the H@@ S@@ 2 rail project has been announced by the UK government .

transport minister Baroness Kra@@ mer said the project would &quot; bring the UK together . &quot;
Scottish transport minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown said he was &quot; exc@@ ited &quot; to work with the UK government on the plan .
phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
when Phase Two is completed , lines will run to Manchester and Le@@ eds .
in June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high @-@ speed link between London and the North of England from Â£ 3@@ 2.@@ 7@@ bn to Â£ 4@@ 2.@@ 6@@ b@@ n@@ .
the UK government , which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland , has instruc@@ ted H@@ S@@ 2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland .
this is to include the possibility of event@@ ual journey times from Glasgo@@ w and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less .
Baroness Kra@@ mer said : &quot; our goal for H@@ S@@ 2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . &quot;
we are driving forward H@@ S@@ 2 because the benefits it will bring are huge .
without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
but it is also about connec@@ tivity , across the UK 18 cities including Glasgo@@ w and Edinburgh will be better connected because of H@@ S@@ 2 .
Scottish Secretary Ali@@ sta@@ ir C@@ arm@@ ich@@ ael added : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;
for the Scottish government , K@@ eit@@ h Brown called on Mr C@@ arm@@ ich@@ ael to &quot; unequi@@ voc@@ ally &quot; back Scotland &apos;s inclusion in the H@@ S@@ 2 network .
Mr Brown said : &quot; high speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland , but also adds Scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain . &quot;
so we are exc@@ ited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland , creating benefit for all and comple@@ ment@@ ing the Glasgo@@ w @-@ Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning .
I look forward to re@@ viewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps .
aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now
Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tab@@ lets and smart phones during take @-@ off and landing despite moves in the US to loo@@ sen regulations covering the devices .
the US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e @-@ books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot; air@@ plane &quot; mode .
passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it anno@@ ying to be unable to access their e @-@ books during take @-@ off@@ s and land@@ ings .
Australian carriers are looking at the decision , which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements , but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
the Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia .
&quot; Casa currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , &quot; it said .
the issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
Virgin , which has already been talking to C@@ ASA about extending the use its in @-@ flight wi @-@ fi entertainment system , was am@@ enable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regul@@ ator .
&quot; we would welcome a review by C@@ ASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have ( wireless in @-@ flight entertainment ) on our planes , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man said .
Q@@ ant@@ as said it would stick with the current rules for now .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take @-@ off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that , &quot; it said .
the FA@@ A ruling applies to American airlines .
however , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FA@@ A &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it .
for US carriers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet .
carriers will need to prove their planes can toler@@ ate radio interference from mobile devices as well as rev@@ ise manu@@ als , training materials , carry @-@ on baggage programs and passenger brie@@ fin@@ gs .
&quot; once an airline veri@@ fies the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use hand@@ held , ligh@@ tw@@ eight electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e @-@ readers , and sm@@ art@@ phones @-@ at all al@@ ti@@ tudes , &quot; the FA@@ A said .
in rare instances of low visibility , the crew will instru@@ ct passengers to turn off their devices during landing .
the group also recommended that heavi@@ er devices should be safely sto@@ wed under seats or in over@@ head b@@ ins during take @-@ off and landing .
travelling B@@ V@@ B fans created terrible scenes with fla@@ res in the Vel@@ t@@ ins Arena before the district der@@ by against Schal@@ ke
Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund announced that there would be serious consequences .
before Friday &apos;s Bundes@@ lig@@ a match against V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the &apos; Ul@@ tras &apos; responded with silence - initially .
it was an unusual , almost gh@@ o@@ stly atmosphere that the fans created until shortly before the k@@ ick @-@ off of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a match between the German run@@ ners @-@ up Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mend and V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , in the Signal I@@ d@@ una Park .
it was mainly the chan@@ ts of away fans that could be heard .
the south stand , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and the lou@@ dest - of B@@ V@@ B fans stand , was initially un@@ usually quiet : no singing and no battle cri@@ es .
the &apos; Cap@@ o &apos;s &apos; po@@ dium , the individual who usually coordin@@ ates the un@@ ison chan@@ ts , remained empty .
and right at the front , on the stand , a single large flag with the text &quot; Stadium B@@ an Section &quot; ble@@ w in the wind .
only when go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller , was the first B@@ V@@ B player to step onto the field , did che@@ ers briefly erup@@ t , as is usually the case .
when his team m@@ ates followed , there was loud singing and scar@@ ves were wa@@ ving - but by no means everywhere .
in the central blocks of the south stand , blocks 12 and 13 , nothing moved .
even stadium announ@@ cer , Nor@@ bert Di@@ ckel , speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the der@@ by victory , the win against Ar@@ senal , the contract extension of coach J@@ Ã¶r@@ gen Klo@@ pp - did not raise spir@@ its .
just five minutes before k@@ ick @-@ off , the Cap@@ o climb@@ ed onto his po@@ dium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point , lifted with a large sh@@ out , as Di@@ ckel asked for a sh@@ out from each section of fans as usual .
as always , the south stand was left until the end , and finally the stand resumed its usual role as the lou@@ dest section of the stadium .
and as soon as the vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous request for &quot; der@@ by winners stand up &quot; came from the south stand upon k@@ ick @-@ off , everything was back to normal .
the previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days .
immediately before the local district der@@ by against FC Schal@@ ke 04 , some of the travelling B@@ V@@ B fans fi@@ red fla@@ res into the crow@@ ds of spec@@ t@@ ators and onto the pitch - and in so doing almost hit go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller .
the k@@ ick @-@ off was delayed on account of the cha@@ otic scenes ,
as a result , B@@ V@@ B Chairman Hans Jo@@ ach@@ im W@@ atz@@ ke had invited the heads of the Dor@@ t@@ mund Ul@@ tras fan group to his office - and if W@@ atz@@ ke &apos;s words are to be believed , this was a rather un@@ comfortable meeting for the fan representatives .
&quot; there will be massive impact for the entire Ultra movement , &quot; announced the B@@ V@@ B Chairman on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , W@@ atz@@ ke prohibited the Ul@@ tras from organising cho@@ re@@ ography for the home match against V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart .
&quot; I have banned it , &quot; he explained .
we cannot ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding py@@ ro@@ techni@@ cs in Sax@@ ony .
in addition , the Ul@@ tras were given the option of several different pun@@ ish@@ ments - they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to accept .
otherwise B@@ V@@ B will impose a san@@ ction by the end of next week , said W@@ atz@@ ke .
&quot; it will be severe , &quot; assured W@@ atz@@ ke .
it will be interesting to see the reactions in the south stand then .
pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pin@@ ch
at a pa@@ wn@@ shop in Ben@@ de@@ meer shopping centre in Singapore , Jan@@ ani Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a is sw@@ apping a gold ban@@ gle , ring and pair of ear@@ rings to pay her dau@@ gh@@ ters &quot; school fees .
&quot; my husband and I have just bought a house so all my money &apos;s stuck there , &quot; Mrs Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a says .
even though she ear@@ ns S $ 3@@ ,000 ( $ 2,@@ 400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well , the monthly family income is insufficient , she says .
indeed , such is demand across parts of sou@@ theast Asia - where household debt is rising - that Val@@ ue@@ Max , where she is carrying out her transaction , this week became the third pa@@ wn@@ shop to list on the Singapore stock exchange .
pa@@ w@@ ning je@@ well@@ ery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S $ 1,@@ 300 in Ms Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans .
typically pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15.@@ 4 per cent offered at United Over@@ seas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .
however , pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .
hence millions of people across the region are turning to pa@@ wn@@ shops as families feel the squ@@ ee@@ ze from rising living costs and bal@@ lo@@ oning household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fu@@ elled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies , lower@@ - and middle @-@ income families are turning to pa@@ wn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .
this week Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s , the rating agency , c@@ ited increasing household leverage , mainly from rising mort@@ g@@ ages , as a risk factor for Asian banks &quot; credi@@ t@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
it said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product rati@@ os in Asia .
Malaysia t@@ opp@@ ed the list at 80 per cent of GDP , up from 60 per cent in 2008 .
economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly emerged from technical recession .
on Thursday , data showed continued export weakness , and a sof@@ tening in consumer demand .
&quot; bottom line is that with costs rising , people in the middle to lower end &#91; of the income scale &#93; will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can , &quot; says Song Sen@@ g w@@ un , econom@@ ist at C@@ IM@@ B , a Malay@@ sian bank .
historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the r@@ ush to pa@@ wn personal bel@@ ong@@ ings , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family je@@ well@@ ery .
in Singapore , about 70 per cent of items pa@@ w@@ ned at the city @-@ state &apos;s 200 pa@@ wn out@@ lets are gold .
people are saying &quot; the gold price looks good , let &apos;s pa@@ wn grand@@ ma &apos;s gold chain and get it back next month .
in Thailand the largest pa@@ wn@@ shop operator , E@@ asy@@ Mon@@ ey , has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its out@@ lets in recent months .
such is the growth in the pa@@ wn business that Val@@ ue@@ Max , operator of the out@@ let at Ben@@ de@@ meer and of 15 others like it in Singapore , plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too , says Y@@ e@@ ah Lee Ch@@ ing , Val@@ ue@@ Max &apos;s executive director .
the company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S $ 6@@ 6@@ m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange .
while some discount len@@ ders have come under fire for high interest rates , Ms Y@@ e@@ ah says that not only does pa@@ w@@ ning offer cheaper rates than other len@@ ders , it also does not add directly to debt .
&quot; customers are mort@@ g@@ aging items that they already own , and mon@@ e@@ ti@@ sing personal assets does not increase household debt , &quot; she says .
there &apos;s an increased social acceptance of pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ king as a means to secure short term , secured financing .
nor are the types of people who use pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers only the financially stret@@ ched .
wealthy people in Singapore also use Val@@ ue@@ Max out@@ lets , pa@@ w@@ ning gold bars or Rol@@ ex wat@@ ches , which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash .
we see customers from all walks of life .
&quot; they include wealthy individuals who need to bor@@ row short term for business vent@@ ures or investments , or small businesses with a need to ti@@ de over their cash flow needs , &quot; says Ms Y@@ e@@ ah .
sometimes they just need the money very quickly .

$ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue package for T@@ as@@ sie health
the Federal Government insi@@ sts a $ 3@@ 25 million rescue package for T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can &apos;t waste the funds .
Federal Health Minister T@@ any@@ a P@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is taking &quot; urgent action &quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state &apos;s aging population , higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints .
the funding , over four years , was decided after government consultations with T@@ as@@ man@@ ian independent MP Andrew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&quot; the Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said today .
the $ 3@@ 25 million package includes a $ 31 million elec@@ tive surgery bli@@ tz .
an additional 26@@ 00 operations including or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c and cat@@ ar@@ act surgery will help clear a back@@ log .
there &apos;s also money for walk @-@ in clin@@ ics in Hob@@ art and La@@ un@@ c@@ est@@ on , better after @-@ hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and the roll@@ out of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments respond to the ideas that front @-@ line clin@@ ici@@ ans have told me will be the best ways to tend to T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s health system , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said .
the minister insisted the T@@ as@@ man@@ ian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime .
the state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Comm@@ on@@ wealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds .
a three @-@ person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie today said the $ 3@@ 25 million would count for little &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s public health system on a more sustainable footing . &quot;
he nevertheless pra@@ ised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
&quot; I &apos;m hope@@ ful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state &apos;s public health system off the critical list , &quot; Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said .
according to the State Government these additional elec@@ tive procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
but federal Opposition health spo@@ kes@@ man Peter D@@ ut@@ ton believes today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; band @-@ aid solution . &quot;
&quot; the reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ri@@ pped $ 4@@ 30 million out of its health system , &quot; he told AB@@ C TV .
you can &apos;t have a state government ri@@ pping out almost half @-@ a @-@ billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth put in $ 300 million and pre@@ tend it &apos;s a good news day .
Mr D@@ ut@@ ton called on Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability , wat@@ ch@@ dog group says
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and po@@ ison gas muni@@ tions , the global chemical weapons wat@@ ch@@ dog said Thursday as fi@@ erce clas@@ hes ra@@ ged in the country &apos;s north , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored .
also Thursday , a Syrian activ@@ ist group said more than 120@@ ,000 people have been killed since the start of the country &apos;s civil war nearly three years ago .
the announcement by the Organization for the Pro@@ hi@@ bition of Chem@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons came one day ahead of the Nov@@ .
1 deadline set by The Hague @-@ based organization for Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or &quot; render in@@ oper@@ able &quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into po@@ ison gas and filling muni@@ tions .
the completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant mile@@ stone in an ambitious tim@@ eline that aims to destroy all of Dam@@ as@@ cus &apos; chemical weapons by mid @-@ 2014 .
destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
however , Dam@@ as@@ cus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stock@@ pil@@ es .
the country is believed to have around 1,000 met@@ ric tons of chemicals and weapons including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the ner@@ ve agent s@@ arin .
the announcement came as fighting ra@@ ged Thursday in the town of Sa@@ fir@@ a , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites , reported the Britain @-@ based Syrian Ob@@ serv@@ atory for Human Rights .
the activ@@ ist group , which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria , said Thursday that 120@@ ,@@ 2@@ 96 people have died .
of those , it said 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 are civilians , including 6,@@ 365 children .
on the government side , it said 2@@ 9,@@ 9@@ 54 are members of President B@@ ash@@ ar Assad &apos;s armed forces , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 are pro @-@ government figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 are Leban@@ ese He@@ z@@ bollah milit@@ ants .
also among the dead it said were 2,@@ 20@@ 2 army def@@ ec@@ tors and some 5,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters , many of them foreigners .
on July 25 , the U.@@ N@@ . estimated 100@@ ,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011 .
it has not updated that figure since .
the conflict has forced some 2 million people to fle@@ e the country .
Assad &apos;s troops have been batt@@ ling reb@@ els , many of them linked to al @-@ Q@@ ai@@ da groups , in Sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks .
the Ob@@ serv@@ atory said there were cas@@ u@@ alties on both sides Thursday but had no specific@@ s .
the fighting under@@ sco@@ red the dangers the chemical weapons &apos; inspec@@ tors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic ar@@ senal in the midst of an ongoing civil war .
a statement from the O@@ PC@@ W , which works closely with the United Nations , said its team was &quot; now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria &apos;s declared critical production and mixing / filling equipment . &quot;
it added that , &quot; no further inspection activities are currently planned . &quot;
earlier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed their first round of verification work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
they were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns , the inspec@@ tors said .
on Thursday , O@@ PC@@ W said the two locations were , according to Syria , &quot; abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites , which were insp@@ ected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear if the facility in Sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two sites that O@@ PC@@ W inspec@@ tors were not able to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the O@@ PC@@ W &apos;s executive committee .
&quot; I sal@@ ute the for@@ titude and courage you &apos;ve all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , &quot; the wat@@ ch@@ dog &apos;s director @-@ general , Ah@@ met U@@ zu@@ m@@ c@@ u , said in comments released by the O@@ PC@@ W .
now in its third year , the civil war p@@ its the primarily Sun@@ ni Muslim reb@@ els against Assad &apos;s government and its security forces , which are st@@ ack@@ ed with members of his Ala@@ wit@@ e se@@ ct , an off@@ shoot of Shi@@ ite Islam .
in other developments , the Ob@@ serv@@ atory &apos;s chief Ram@@ i Ab@@ dur@@ rah@@ man said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria &apos;s coastal province of Lat@@ akia .
the cause of the b@@ last was not known , he said .
anger over Bali bomb pl@@ ot@@ ter &apos;s sentence
survi@@ vors and relatives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in the 2002 Bali bom@@ bing have re@@ acted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the pl@@ ot@@ ters to face justice , saying Um@@ ar P@@ ate@@ k should face a fir@@ ing squ@@ ad .
P@@ ate@@ k , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South @-@ East Asia &apos;s most wanted , was yesterday sent@@ enced to 20 years in j@@ ail for his role in building the explo@@ sive devices used in the bom@@ bing .
he could be released within 15 years if granted par@@ ole .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night@@ clubs in the popular tourist area of K@@ uta which left 20@@ 2 people dead , including 88 Austra@@ li@@ ans , and injured scores more .
he was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism @-@ related charges , including a wave of bom@@ b@@ ings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas E@@ ve in 2000 .
prosec@@ ut@@ ors had demanded a life sentence , although they could have pushed that the man du@@ b@@ bed the &quot; Dem@@ oli@@ tion Man &quot; for his reputation as a master bomb @-@ maker be sent@@ enced to death .
the decision has re@@ ign@@ ited painful memories for Per@@ th mother June Cor@@ teen , who lost her 39 @-@ year @-@ old twin dau@@ gh@@ ters Jan@@ e and J@@ enny in the destruction un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed by P@@ ate@@ k and his co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ators almost a decade ago .
fighting back te@@ ars , she said P@@ ate@@ k should have been sent@@ enced to death .
I really feel that he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other guys .
&quot; he should be put in front of the fir@@ ing squ@@ ad , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen told A@@ AP .
I have to live every day without seeing more grand@@ children , and my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
the S@@ ari Club was lev@@ elled when a massive bomb loaded into a van par@@ ked outside was de@@ ton@@ ated just after 11@@ pm on October 12 , 2002 .
Peter Hu@@ gh@@ es was in Pad@@ dy &apos;s Bar where a suicide bom@@ ber de@@ ton@@ ated a back@@ pack loaded with explo@@ si@@ ves just 20 seconds earlier .
he lap@@ sed into a month @-@ long com@@ a in the wake of the bom@@ bing , and &quot; died &quot; three times while on life support .
Mr Hu@@ gh@@ es said P@@ ate@@ k should have shared the same fate as three other members of the J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ ah terror cell responsible for the car@@ n@@ age - Am@@ ro@@ zi , Mu@@ k@@ h@@ las and Ima@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a - who were executed four years ago .
really , this guy should get the death penalty before anybody .
to keep him alive , well , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
to get 20 years , after killing 20@@ 2 people and in@@ j@@ uring many hundreds , it &apos;s not much .
P@@ ate@@ k is the last of the Bali bom@@ bers to face justice .
he had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended in January 2011 in the Pakist@@ ani town of Ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where US forces killed former al @-@ Q@@ a@@ eda chief O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden less than four months later .
during the trial , an F@@ BI agent testi@@ fied that intelligence reports had revealed P@@ ate@@ k was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re @-@ establish links between South @-@ East Asian terrorist groups and al @-@ Q@@ a@@ eda .
&quot; he didn &apos;t give himself up , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
until just recently , he really didn &apos;t feel sorry for how much grie@@ f he caused other people .
the verdi@@ ct comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year , which will be marked by cerem@@ on@@ ies in Bali and Australia .
&quot; there will be a lot of te@@ ars this year , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
P@@ ate@@ k may yet appeal his sentence .
FA@@ A : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on planes ( but not make cell phone calls )
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate @-@ to @-@ gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cell@@ phones - under much @-@ anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
but passengers sh@@ ouldn &apos;t expect changes to happen immediately .
how fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline , FA@@ A Administrator Michael Hu@@ er@@ ta said at a news conference .
airlines will have to show the FA@@ A how their air@@ planes meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;ve updating their flight crew training manu@@ als and rules for sto@@ wing devices to reflect the new guidelines .
the FA@@ A said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
Delta and J@@ et@@ Blue were among the air@@ lin@@ ers who have already submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FA@@ A said in a statement .
currently , passengers are required to turn off their sm@@ art@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door clo@@ ses .
they &apos;re not supposed to re@@ start them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the cap@@ tain gives the go @-@ ahead .
passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane desc@@ ends to land and not re@@ start them until the plane is on the ground .
under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during ta@@ ke@@ off@@ s , land@@ ings and ta@@ xi@@ ing , the FA@@ A said .
most new air@@ lin@@ ers and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi@@ fi at higher al@@ ti@@ tudes are expected to meet the criteria .
Lau@@ ra G@@ la@@ ding , president of the Association of Professional F@@ light At@@ ten@@ dan@@ ts , welcomed the changes .
&quot; once the new policy is safely implemented - and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win @-@ win , &quot; G@@ la@@ ding said in a statement .
we &apos;re frankly tired of feeling like &apos; hall monit@@ ors &apos; when it comes to this issue .
but connecting to the Internet to surf , exchange emails , text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet , the agency said .
passengers will be told to switch their sm@@ art@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices to air@@ plane mode .
so , still no Wor@@ ds With Fri@@ ends , the online S@@ cra@@ b@@ ble @-@ type game that actor Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win was playing on his sm@@ art@@ phone in 2011 when he was fam@@ ously bo@@ oted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was par@@ ked at the gate .
and heavi@@ er devices such as la@@ pt@@ ops will continue to have to be sto@@ wed because of concern they might in@@ j@@ ure someone if they go flying around the cabin .
in @-@ flight cell@@ phone calls also will continue to be prohibited .
regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission , not the FA@@ A .
FA@@ A may lift ban on some electronic devices during ta@@ ke@@ off and landing
last month , National Transpor@@ tation Safety Board Mark Rosen@@ ker , a C@@ BS News national transportation safety expert , said that cell phones are still considered a risk .
&quot; cell phones , that really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create interference with navig@@ ational devices , but we do know , according to the F@@ CC , that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they &apos;re in the air , &quot; Rosen@@ ker said .
an industry advisory committee created by the FA@@ A to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
pressure has been building on the FA@@ A in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
critics such as Sen@@ . Cla@@ ire Mc@@ Cas@@ kill , D @-@ M@@ o . , cont@@ end there is no valid safety reason for the prohi@@ bitions .
the restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .
the FA@@ A began restri@@ cting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radi@@ os , the high @-@ tech g@@ ad@@ gets of their day .
new air@@ lin@@ ers are far more reli@@ ant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FA@@ A to be resistant to electronic interference .
airlines have been offering Wi @-@ Fi use at cru@@ ising al@@ ti@@ tudes to passengers for several years .
planes modified for Wi @-@ Fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
the vast majority of air@@ lin@@ ers should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , Hu@@ er@@ ta said .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much lower power radio trans@@ missions than previous generations of devices .
e @-@ readers , for example , em@@ it only minimal trans@@ missions when turning a page .
but trans@@ missions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data .
among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been Ama@@ zon@@ .com.
in 2011 , company officials loaded an air@@ liner full of their Kin@@ dle e @-@ readers and fle@@ w it around to test for problems but found none .
FA@@ A advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .
Dou@@ glas Ki@@ dd of the National Association of Air@@ line Pas@@ sen@@ gers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said there are only an@@ ec@@ dot@@ al reports from pil@@ ots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .
however , the committee recommended the FA@@ A allow pil@@ ots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument land@@ ings in low visibility .
a travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them common @-@ sense accommodations for a traveling public now bri@@ st@@ ling with technology .
&quot; we &apos;re pleased the FA@@ A recogni@@ zes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security , &quot; said Roger Do@@ w , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .
bird air@@ lifted to safety from North Sea rig released back into wild
a bird air@@ lifted ash@@ ore after being found exhau@@ sted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild .
the water rail was put on a helicopter to Aber@@ de@@ en last month before being nur@@ sed back to health by the Scottish SP@@ CA at its rescue centre in Al@@ lo@@ a .
centre manager Co@@ lin S@@ ed@@ don said : &quot; this water rail was likely a winter mig@@ rant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea . &quot;
it seems the bird became exhau@@ sted and managed to find refuge on the oil rig .
he added : &quot; it was unable to fly off again so we were cont@@ acted for help . &quot;
the water rail was fit and well by the time it was released .
is Europe &apos;s elite ready to do business with Britain ?
business for Britain launched in April with a ple@@ dge to bring business together and define what the UK &apos;s wealth and job cre@@ ators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU .
to that end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive po@@ ll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain , business and the EU .
You@@ Go@@ v poll@@ ed over 1,000 business leaders , broadly representative of Britain &apos;s business sizes , sectors and regions .
the conclusions of the po@@ ll will come as a surprise to many .
we found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe , focusing on countries that are modernis@@ ing and growing while the EU states stag@@ n@@ ate .
they want to see the Government priori@@ tise new trading links with the likes of China , India and Brazil , rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming the EU &apos;s ar@@ cane institutions .
when asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to West@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ content with the Single Market , with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ ed the benefits of being part of Europe &apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses , traditionally the most pro @-@ European of companies , agreed .
finally , and most t@@ ell@@ ingly of all , our po@@ ll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade , not politics .
this finding , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , shows that business is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings powers back to the UK .
the stak@@ es are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent s@@ wing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum .
the Prime Minister should be in no doubt : this po@@ ll shows that British business backs his plan for rene@@ goti@@ ating the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
it also shows that business expects that rene@@ goti@@ ation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK .
a better deal for British business is possible , and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embark@@ s on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and , as the findings of our po@@ ll show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels &quot; regulatory approach .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s Alex@@ ei Mil@@ ler says pipeline in Bulgaria starts new gas era
the start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s chief said .
&quot; a land@@ mark event has taken place today : construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the most large @-@ scale and important project in Europe , &quot; Gaz@@ pro@@ m Chairman Alex@@ ei Mil@@ ler said in a statement Thursday .
this project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent .
South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia &apos;s export routes through Europe .
a contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its counter@@ parts in Ukraine , which hosts most of Russia &apos;s gas for Europe , adds a layer of risk to conventional routes , officials say .
Mil@@ ler said the direct connection to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot; forever . &quot;
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a dis@@ counted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m said construction should begin in other down@@ stream countries by year &apos;s end .
the pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cu@@ bic feet of natural gas .
nothing be@@ ats Germany as a property location for national and international investors .
the economic situation is right , and the financing options are fantastic .
this was the message of the 9th &apos; Immobili@@ ent@@ ag &apos; ( Property Day ) organised by the BÃ¶r@@ sen Zeitung ( stock exchange newspaper ) .
the German property markets are benef@@ iting from the country &apos;s economic strength and general conditions which , compared with the rest of Europe , are very competitive .
this was pointed out by Christian Ul@@ bri@@ ch , Jones L@@ ang La@@ S@@ alle CEO for Europe , the Ne@@ ar East and Africa , at the 9th &apos; Immobili@@ ent@@ ag &apos; ( Property Day ) organised by the BÃ¶r@@ sen Zeitung ( stock exchange newspaper ) .
the extent to which German commercial properties are sought after is evident in the transaction volumes , said Ul@@ bri@@ ch .
in the first three quarters of this year , there was an increase of 31 % compared to the same period the year before .
in Great Britain , growth stands at just 6 % , and in France at 19 % .
&quot; property investments offer an attractive rate of return , &quot; said Ul@@ bri@@ ch .
the yield gap between properties and federal government bonds is at a historically high level .

two Y@@ M@@ CA employees charged with sex offences before alleg@@ ations against Jon@@ athan Lord , Royal Commission he@@ ars
two Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W employees had been charged with child sex offences before alleg@@ ations were raised against Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h child care worker Jon@@ athan Lord in 2011 , the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard .
but in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot; never dealt with an incident of child sexual ass@@ ault within its organisation , &quot; the Commission was told .
chief executive officer Phil@@ lip H@@ are was asked about one case where a Y@@ M@@ CA employee was charged child porno@@ graphy offences , and another when a gym instru@@ ctor at the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h Hall was convi@@ cted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991 .
Mr H@@ are told G@@ ail Fur@@ ness , coun@@ sel assi@@ sting the Commission , he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one .
he conc@@ eded the Y@@ M@@ CA &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claiming &quot; there have been external audi@@ ts of the Y@@ M@@ CA that have recognised the Y@@ M@@ CA as being at the fore@@ front of child safety . &quot;
evidence before the commission is that Y@@ M@@ CA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year .
Mr H@@ are , who started with the Y@@ M@@ CA when he was 21 , conc@@ eded management &quot; from myself down &quot; failed by recru@@ iting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy bre@@ aches .
earlier this year Lord was convi@@ cted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the Y@@ M@@ CA .
he was j@@ ailed for a minimum of six years .
but Mr H@@ are rejected the suggestion the Y@@ M@@ CA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord &apos;s bre@@ aches of child safety .
staff gave evidence they observed bre@@ aches including Lord being alone with children , bab@@ y@@ sitting them priv@@ ately , having them sit on his la@@ p , saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone .
Dani@@ elle O@@ ck@@ well , who was super@@ vised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , testi@@ fied she found the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h children &apos;s services manager J@@ acqu@@ i Bar@@ n@@ at who super@@ vised Lord &quot; very intim@@ i@@ dating and hard to approach a lot of the time . &quot;
the CEO said he did not accept staff &apos;s evidence that they were un@@ comfortable with reporting up@@ wards to their managers .
rather , he said , their friend@@ ships with Lord clou@@ ded their jud@@ gements about reporting him .
Mr H@@ are said he had provided his view to the Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot; Jon@@ athan Lord incident &quot; was &quot; not about reporting &quot; by staff , and the board agreed with him .
Mr H@@ are said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the alleg@@ ations emerged was made by Y@@ M@@ CA general manager of children &apos;s services Li@@ am Whit@@ ley .
he said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot; over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous &quot; and poorly executed .
Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W was not a child safe organisation at the time Jon@@ athan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Sm@@ all@@ bone of Gri@@ ff@@ ith University told the commission .
he said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in recruitment , screening , in@@ duction , training and supervision of staff .

Tony Blair said he &apos;d sei@@ ze the chance to return as Britain &apos;s prime minister - but acknowled@@ ges a com@@ eb@@ ack is unlikely .
in an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59 @-@ year @-@ old aired his views on various domestic policies .
since he stood down in June 2007 after a decade as leader , Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics , con@@ fin@@ ing most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as en@@ vo@@ y to the Quar@@ tet of Middle East peac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers .
asked if he would return to the post of prime minister , Mr Blair was quoted by London &apos;s E@@ ven@@ ing Standard as saying : &quot; yes , sure , but it &apos;s not likely to happen is it , so ... &quot;
as crow@@ ds of horse @-@ showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Hor@@ se of the Year , they knew the competition would be tough .
but nobody was quite ready for three @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ent@@ on Kir@@ kland .
not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps , the to@@ dd@@ ler and his pet Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony T@@ off@@ ee tro@@ t@@ ted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents tra@@ iling behind .
the in@@ separ@@ able pair - who are the same height - were comm@@ ended for appearance , behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sun@@ ny@@ bank Equ@@ est@@ rian Centre , in Ru@@ dry near Cardiff .
taking to the stage against men and women in smart bow@@ ler h@@ ats , he ti@@ pped his flat cap at a ja@@ un@@ ty angle and par@@ aded two @-@ year @-@ old T@@ off@@ ee around the ring .
F@@ ent@@ on was lau@@ ded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years .
and T@@ off@@ ee received top marks for his appearance and personality .
F@@ ent@@ on was given T@@ off@@ ee as a third birthday present last March and has practi@@ sed with the Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony every day since .
his mother Don@@ na , 30 , said : &quot; F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee are a great double act . &quot;
they were up against all com@@ ers but the two of them wal@@ ked off with the gold cup and ro@@ se@@ tte .
it was only the second time he had compet@@ ed with T@@ off@@ ee and we were all ec@@ static when he won .
complete stran@@ gers in the arena all thought he was so phenom@@ en@@ al they wanted photos taken with him .
the young@@ ster , from the village of N@@ ant@@ y@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ b@@ b@@ w V@@ ale , South Wales , is following in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ unt Sharon Ho@@ well@@ s , who has been showing horses for more than 10 years .
Mrs Ho@@ well@@ s said : &quot; the whole place was electric and everybody was che@@ ering and cla@@ pping . &quot;
he was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job .
F@@ ent@@ on is animal mad - he lo@@ ves horses , tra@@ ctors and farms and has got two chi@@ ck@@ ens which he looks after .
the way he has started he &apos;ll be at the Hor@@ se of the Year show before long - and I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll do well .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual horse show said : &quot; F@@ ent@@ on is only three but he knows how to handle his p@@ ony . &quot;
they are a great team together .
the judges marked F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring .
they look for good te@@ am@@ work between the p@@ ony and the hand@@ ler - F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee were the best in the ring .
I &apos;m sure F@@ ent@@ on was helped by his cu@@ te clothes , he really looked the part .
China ple@@ a paper &apos; to be over@@ hau@@ le@@ d@@ &apos;
a Chinese newspaper that made a front @-@ page appeal for the release of a re@@ porter accused of de@@ fam@@ ation is to be over@@ hau@@ led , a press regul@@ ator says .
the Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ hou @-@ based New Express made a rare public ple@@ a for the release of journalist C@@ hen Y@@ ong@@ z@@ hou .
but Mr C@@ hen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to fabri@@ cate stories about a part state @-@ owned company .
now the New Express is to under@@ go &quot; full recti@@ fication , &quot; the regul@@ ator said .
the &quot; recti@@ fication &quot; order came from the Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong Administration of Press and Publi@@ cation , Radio , Film and Tel@@ evision .
a preliminary investigation showed that Y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing News Group &apos;s New Express had published several un@@ true reports about listed company Zo@@ om@@ lion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013 .
&quot; new Express &apos;s edi@@ torial management was dis@@ ordered , &quot; the regul@@ ator said in a statement .
it said it had decided to &quot; impose an administrative penalty on C@@ hen Y@@ ong@@ z@@ hou by re@@ vo@@ king his re@@ porter &apos;s license . &quot;
it had also &quot; instruc@@ ted Y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing News Group to undertake a complete recti@@ fication of New Express , and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately rev@@ ise New Express &apos;s leadership team . &quot;
Mr C@@ hen wrote several articles for the New Express alleg@@ ing financial irregularities at a construction @-@ equipment company called Zo@@ om@@ lion .
after he was de@@ tained , his newspaper published two front @-@ page appe@@ als for his release , saying it backed his journ@@ alism .
but Mr C@@ hen then appeared on state television ad@@ mitting he had published false stories for money .
&quot; in this case I &apos;ve caused damages to Zo@@ om@@ lion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public &apos;s trust , &quot; he told state broad@@ ca@@ ster CC@@ TV .
I did this mainly because I han@@ k@@ ered after money and f@@ ame .
I &apos;ve realised my wron@@ g@@ doing .
following Mr C@@ hen &apos;s apo@@ logy , New Express issued a front @-@ page apo@@ logy , saying it had failed to properly check his reports .
several high @-@ profile susp@@ ects have made tel@@ ev@@ ised con@@ fes@@ sions recently .
experts say con@@ fes@@ sions are still rout@@ inely co@@ er@@ ced , despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to in@@ crimin@@ ate themselves .
us @-@ Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found
one of the most sophisticated drug smu@@ ggling tun@@ nels between the USA and Mexico has been found , complete with its own lighting , ven@@ tilation and electric rail systems .
us authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they have ever discovered .
the tunnel , which zi@@ g@@ z@@ ags the length of nearly six football pit@@ ches , links ware@@ houses near Ti@@ ju@@ ana , Mexico and San Die@@ go , USA .
the area is filled with non@@ descri@@ pt ware@@ houses , making it easier to conc@@ eal trucks being loaded with drugs .
the tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through un@@ detected , authorities said .
authorities sei@@ zed eight @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half tons of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 3@@ 27 po@@ unds of co@@ ca@@ ine in connection with the tunnel &apos;s discovery , according to court records .
three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine with intent to distribute .
they face prison sentences between 10 years and life im@@ prison@@ ment if convi@@ cted .
in No@@ g@@ ales , Ari@@ zona , smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers tap into vast underground dra@@ in@@ age can@@ als .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th major passage discovered in San Die@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels have been discovered after central Mexico &apos;s mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ vest in October , which presents drug car@@ tels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a roughly 700 @-@ yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Ti@@ ju@@ ana home to two San Die@@ go ware@@ houses .
Or@@ land@@ o Blo@@ om and Mir@@ anda Ker@@ r still love each other
actors Or@@ land@@ o Blo@@ om and Model Mir@@ anda Ker@@ r want to go their separate ways .
however , in an interview , Blo@@ om has said that he and Ker@@ r still love each other .
Mir@@ anda Ker@@ r and Or@@ land@@ o Blo@@ om are parents to two @-@ year @-@ old Fl@@ ynn .
actor Or@@ land@@ o Blo@@ om announced his separation from his wife , super@@ model Mir@@ anda Ker@@ r .
in an interview with US journalist K@@ atie Cou@@ ric , which is to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Blo@@ om said , &quot; sometimes life doesn &apos;t go exactly as we plan or hope for . &quot;
he and Ker@@ r still love each other , emphasised the 36 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; we &apos;re going to support one another and love each other as parents to Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
Ker@@ r and Blo@@ om have been married since 2010 . their son Fl@@ ynn was born in 2011 .
according to dic@@ tion@@ aries , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a sub @-@ category of veget@@ ari@@ anism , yet the two do differ considerably .
for while veget@@ arians allow themselves to consu@@ me cream tar@@ ts , ice cream or a strong E@@ dam , these indul@@ gen@@ ces are off the menu for ve@@ gans .
milk , cheese , egg - alongside avoiding meat and fish , ve@@ gans refra@@ in from eating all products of animal origin - even honey is not permitted .
you might ask what is left , however , upon closer inspection the world of ve@@ gan nutrition is characterised by great res@@ our@@ ce@@ fulness .
&quot; spre@@ ads are very popular , &quot; explained U@@ te Hen@@ kel@@ mann the owner of the local health food store , which provides a host of special products for ve@@ gans .
Re@@ u@@ ben Pro@@ ctor also likes to visit the store on &quot; Dom@@ gasse . &quot;
the New Ze@@ al@@ ander has been ve@@ gan for 13 years , and in Lam@@ per@@ thei@@ m he can find ( almost ) everything that he needs to get by . &quot; in 1997 I adjusted my diet and became a veget@@ arian . &quot;
at the turn of the millenni@@ um I took the next step and became ve@@ gan .
&quot; however , it wasn &apos;t just the diet that convinced me , but also my choice of shoes , &quot; said Pro@@ ctor , who pre@@ fers artificial leather over normal leather .
he realised that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products .
first and foremost , being ve@@ gan is a matter of ethics .
&quot; I don &apos;t want animals to have to die for me , &quot; said Pro@@ ctor , expressing the ma@@ x@@ im of ve@@ gans , which applies to all their consumer behaviour .
rather than missing bur@@ gers , scra@@ mb@@ led eggs or gum@@ mi bears , the ve@@ gan has quickly discovered entirely new products that really insp@@ ire him .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says Pro@@ ctor now , &quot; in actual fact being ve@@ gan is not about doing without , it &apos;s not about as@@ ce@@ ticism , but rather it is an enhan@@ cement . &quot; regarding the assumption that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options , Pro@@ ctor puts this down to force of hab@@ it .
and it is precisely this conditioning that results in many a well @-@ inten@@ tioned attempt failing .
&quot; the temp@@ tation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up , similar to with smoking , &quot; says Pro@@ ctor , providing a comparison .
and he argu@@ es : &quot; certain flav@@ ours are not linked to animal produce . &quot;
often it is the her@@ bs or the type of preparation that provide the flav@@ our .
&quot; you can , however , create the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the ve@@ gan .
for example , when attending a barbe@@ cue party , Pro@@ ctor brings auber@@ g@@ ines , mus@@ h@@ rooms and also a few ve@@ gan s@@ aus@@ ages .
he ensures a balanced , varied diet , whereby everything should also have a good hear@@ ty flav@@ our .
of course you want to have something with a bit of b@@ ite , that is fair enough .
&quot; it should be tasty , but this doesn &apos;t necessarily mean animal @-@ based food , &quot; said Pro@@ ctor .
he has not suffered any damage to his health or eating disorders - another wide @-@ spread assumption .
conver@@ ting has had a positive effect for me .
I do not consu@@ me any foreign ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol and have increased my vit@@ amin in@@ take .
there are top athletes who also have an exclusively ve@@ gan diet .
&quot; my blood values are excellent - I have myself checked on a regular basis , &quot; revealed Pro@@ ctor .
many critics of ve@@ gan@@ ism warn in particular of the lack of vit@@ amin B@@ 12 .
&quot; because animals are fed on fo@@ d@@ der instead of gra@@ zing , it is dubi@@ ous whether the vit@@ amin B@@ 12 content in meat sold in free@@ zers is actually high , &quot; comm@@ ented Pro@@ ctor .
for ve@@ gans there is also the option of taking the co @-@ enz@@ y@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my B@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explained .
Pro@@ ctor does not have to travel far to buy food .
there are basic foodstuffs available everywhere , and every super@@ market now has so@@ ya milk and other products .
I can find everything I need locally .
I only purchase special items now and again .
&quot; many people over@@ look the fact that even though ready @-@ made ve@@ gan products are expensive , it is well @-@ known that this is also the case for &quot; normal &quot; ready @-@ made products .
in any case , the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed .
&quot; in home cooking , there is much to be discovered - with a few minor t@@ weak@@ s you can achieve good , if not sometimes better results , &quot; said Pro@@ ctor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine in place of but@@ ter , a little more bak@@ ing powder and bi@@ car@@ bon@@ ate of so@@ da in place of egg - Pro@@ ctor has even managed to aston@@ ish his in @-@ laws with his ve@@ gan cheese c@@ akes .
the ve@@ gan adds new sp@@ ice to family parties .
when you cook together there is a certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as varied as the people themselves , &quot; said Pro@@ ctor .
of course he has already met with scep@@ ticism .
do you not like my food any more ?
&quot; should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? &quot; - as a ve@@ gan you have to be tac@@ tful in such matters .
&quot; I do not dis@@ approve of people , I am part of this society , &quot; said Pro@@ ctor , explaining that he was not choosing a life of isolation .
and on closer observation , the everyday world does not appear quite so &apos; un @-@ ve@@ gan &apos; - and ve@@ gans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed .
fast food is also permitted .
chips are available everywhere !
&quot; many don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab houses offer fal@@ af@@ el , or even veget@@ arian y@@ u@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says Pro@@ ctor .
in a pi@@ zz@@ eria he avoi@@ ds past@@ a dishes or just orders a pi@@ zza without cheese , all just a question of hab@@ it .
restaurants are slowly adapting to things .
&quot; when I began eating a ve@@ gan diet 13 years ago , things were even more difficult , &quot; says the New Ze@@ al@@ ander , and he points out : &quot; you have to talk with people , make them aware . &quot;
&quot; if enough requests are made , they will perhaps be inc@@ lined to expand their menus , &quot; he hopes .
there are ve@@ gan restaurants opening up , such as the Kom@@ bÃ¼@@ se in Mannheim or CafÃ© Vogel@@ frei .
Pro@@ ctor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
essentially , ve@@ gan dishes are for everyone .
anyone can eat them , they are the exact opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes , on the other hand , are exclusive , in the tru@@ est sense of the word , as they rule others out , &quot; assessed Pro@@ ctor .
&quot; if you want to avoid food sc@@ and@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way to rule out the majority of sc@@ and@@ als from the outset , &quot; says Pro@@ ctor .
however , purchasing ve@@ gan products can be difficult to start with .
O@@ In@@ ce you come to understand that pe@@ an@@ uts , in particular , may also contain animal additives as a col@@ ou@@ rant , people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics with so many hur@@ d@@ les and pit@@ falls .
therefore , for this reason and others , Re@@ u@@ ben Pro@@ ctor and L@@ ars Th@@ om@@ sen have written a book . &quot; Ve@@ gan@@ issi@@ mo - Tier@@ ische In@@ hal@@ ts@@ stoffe und ihre Altern@@ ati@@ ven &quot; ( Ve@@ gan@@ issi@@ mo - Anim@@ al In@@ gre@@ dients and their Altern@@ atives ) explains the many ingredients hidden in both foodstuffs and cleaning agents .
&quot; you gradually develop an internal scanner and you know which symbols and logos you have to look out for . &quot; Pro@@ ctor has learned that &quot; it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or stum@@ ble . &quot;
ve@@ gan@@ ism is an important moral comp@@ ass , which has an effect on your consciousness .
perhaps he won &apos;t manage to help you break old hab@@ its altogether , but at least he manages to teach consumers to cri@@ tically question their hab@@ its .

as recently as last Tuesday , the Nas@@ da@@ q indi@@ ces were not calculated for one hour due to data transfer errors .
in August of this year there were two break@@ down@@ s in a single week .
first of all , US investment bank Gold@@ man Sach@@ s sent large quantities of incorrect purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems .
as a result , the stock exchange operators required almost an entire day to look through and delete the orders .
two days later , half of all stock dealing in the USA came to a stand@@ still for several hours , due to a computer failure in the Nas@@ da@@ q exchange .
furthermore , last year the listing of Facebook on the stock exchange caused quite a fur@@ ore .
the Nas@@ da@@ q systems could not cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders , the Exchange Supervisory Authority established at a later date , imposing a record penalty of 10 million dollars on the company .
Kon@@ stanz : cycli@@ st kno@@ cks over 63 @-@ year @-@ old man
according to the police , the accident occurred on Thursday evening at around 10 : 00 p.m. , when a 26 @-@ year @-@ old man was cycling illegally , on the left foot@@ path of the Bahn@@ hof@@ platz in the direction of Markt@@ stÃ¤@@ tte , on a ladies bicycle .
according to police , when a 63 @-@ year @-@ old man suddenly step@@ ped out of a pu@@ b onto the foot@@ path , the cycli@@ st was unable to bra@@ ke in time .
during the subsequent col@@ li@@ sion , the pedestrian was thrown against the wall of the building , and then fell onto the ground , suffering a lac@@ er@@ ation to the head that measured around 15 cen@@ timet@@ res in length .
an am@@ bul@@ ance team brought the injured man to the clin@@ ic for medical treatment .
British police serve Ass@@ ange with extra@@ dition notice
B@@ ti@@ tish police served an extra@@ dition notice today on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange , who has taken refuge in Ecuador &apos;s em@@ bass@@ y in London and requested asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said they had served a &quot; sur@@ render notice &quot; on the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station , adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest .
Ass@@ ange faces extra@@ dition to Sweden over sex crime alleg@@ ations , having exhau@@ sted his options under British law when the Supreme Court over@@ turned his appeal against extra@@ dition earlier this month .
fe@@ aring Stockholm would pass him on to the US , he sought refuge at Ecuador &apos;s em@@ bass@@ y in London on June 19 , asking the South American country for political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard has &quot; served a sur@@ render notice upon a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man said .
he remains in breach of his b@@ ail conditions .
the em@@ bass@@ y dec@@ lined to comment on the serving of the police notice .
Ass@@ ange fears he will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted from Sweden to the United States to face possible es@@ pion@@ age charges , after rele@@ asing more than 25@@ 0@@ ,000 US diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks anti @-@ sec@@ rec@@ y website .
driver spe@@ eding at 13@@ 0@@ mp@@ h with hot drink between legs fined Â£ 1,000
a motor@@ ist has been fined Â£ 1,000 for driving at up to 13@@ 0@@ mp@@ h ( 2@@ 10@@ km / h ) with a hot drink balanced between his legs .
Andrew Ho@@ wie , 35 , of Ti@@ p@@ tree , E@@ sse@@ x , was spot@@ ted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A@@ 120 at Bra@@ in@@ tree on 27 May .
when police stopped him they discovered the ta@@ ke@@ away drink between his legs .
at Col@@ chester Ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ates &apos; Court Ho@@ wie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention .
seven points added to his licence resulted in him receiving a six @-@ month driving ban .
Ho@@ wie was also ordered to pay costs of Â£ 90 and a victim sur@@ charge of Â£ 100 .
tax on foreign property owners to bur@@ st London &apos;s bub@@ ble
the Treas@@ ury have provisi@@ on@@ ally co@@ sted out the C@@ G@@ T measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 Budget , introduced a 7 % rate of stam@@ p duty for homes co@@ sting more than Â£ 2@@ m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals .
already the stam@@ p duty take for residential property in the bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of West@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; C@@ hel@@ sea , which stood at Â£ 7@@ 08 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North East , North West and Yor@@ k@@ shire and the Hum@@ ber put together .
Mr C@@ ook said : &quot; following increases in stam@@ p duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti @-@ avoi@@ dance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under @-@ tax@@ ed irrespective of the effect of the out @-@ dated council tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this move could make some foreign investors re@@ tic@@ ent to buy property in London or current owners reluct@@ ant to sell , &quot; he added .
Prime property - the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price - in the aff@@ lu@@ ent south @-@ west London belt , which stret@@ ches from F@@ ul@@ ham to W@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has increased by a record 11.@@ 8 % over the past year .
prices in central London continued to show steady year @-@ on @-@ year growth of 5.@@ 6 % but were o@@ vers@@ ha@@ do@@ wed by a bur@@ ge@@ oning &quot; domestic market &quot; with the city &apos;s south west , north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and east ( 6.@@ 5 % ) all experiencing an up@@ tick , according to research from Sa@@ vi@@ lls .
scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to its mood .
earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wa@@ g their tails more to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while ner@@ vous dogs have a left @-@ dominated s@@ wish .
but now scientists say that fellow can@@ ines can spot and respond to these sub@@ tle tail differences .
pro@@ f Geor@@ gio Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gara , a neuro@@ scienti@@ st from the University of Tren@@ to , said : &quot; it is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stim@@ uli that inv@@ ok@@ es positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we attempted to look at it in other species .
he added that just as in humans , for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left @-@ handed movement and vice vers@@ a , and the two h@@ emis@@ pher@@ es played different roles in emotions .
to find out more about how dogs react to the lo@@ p @-@ sided tail w@@ ags of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals as they wat@@ ched films of other dogs .
they measured the pets &apos; heart rates and analy@@ sed their behaviour .
it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
pro@@ f Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gara said : &quot; we presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a natu@@ rali@@ stic version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to get rid of any other con@@ founding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
when the animals saw an otherwise expres@@ sion@@ less dog move its tail to the right ( from the tail @-@ wag@@ ging dog &apos;s point of view ) , they stayed perfectly relaxed .
but when they spot@@ ted a tail ve@@ er predomin@@ antly to the left ( again from the tail @-@ s@@ wishing dog &apos;s point of view ) , their heart rates picked up and they looked anxi@@ ous .
pro@@ f Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gara said he didn &apos;t think that the dogs were inten@@ tionally communic@@ ating with each other through these movements .
instead , he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and sh@@ ouldn &apos;t feel worried about .
he said : &quot; if you have several meetings with other dogs , and frequently their tail wag@@ ging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . &quot;
the researchers say the findings could give owners , v@@ ets and tra@@ iners a better insight into their animal &apos;s emotions .
dog behaviour expert John Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w , a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol &apos;s school of veter@@ inary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to can@@ ines .
last year a team from the University of Lin@@ col@@ n found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
and in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada , he said : &quot; dogs were more likely to approach a ro@@ bot dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made to wa@@ g left rather than right , rather than becoming anxi@@ ous - the opposite way around to the Italian study . &quot;
he said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpre@@ ting the animals in the films or rob@@ o @-@ dogs as can@@ ines .
a study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help , he explained .
&quot; while there is considerable evidence from many different m@@ amm@@ als that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be ham@@ mer@@ ed out - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
however , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .

Pope Francis to name first car@@ din@@ als in February
Pope Francis will create new car@@ din@@ als of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22 , the Vati@@ can announced Thursday .
Car@@ din@@ als are the highest @-@ ranking c@@ ler@@ gy in the Catholic Church below the pop@@ e , and they &apos;re the ones who elect pop@@ es , so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor .
there are now 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , once a car@@ din@@ al reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pop@@ e -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors . &quot;
in a statement announ@@ cing the news , Father Feder@@ ico Lom@@ bar@@ di , a Vati@@ can spo@@ kes@@ man , said a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the ceremony to elev@@ ate the new car@@ din@@ als , known as a consi@@ story .
&quot; Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to con@@ vo@@ ke February &apos;s consi@@ story in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of car@@ din@@ als from different parts of the world , &quot; Lom@@ bar@@ di said .
Jack Val@@ ero of Catholic Vo@@ ices said that by February , the number of car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors was likely to have dropped .
he said usually a pop@@ e would name as many car@@ din@@ als as was needed to raise the number of car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors back to 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 as he wanted .
next year &apos;s consi@@ story would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year , Val@@ ero said .
at the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nomin@@ ate car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of Roman Catho@@ lics are in South America , but they have a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Car@@ din@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world t@@ asked with looking into ways to reform the church .
in the past the Pope decided everything on his own .
&quot; now Francis has selected these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; Val@@ ero said .
he said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that Francis would ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but we &apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it &apos;s all completely new .
Val@@ ero said pop@@ es typically elev@@ ated bis@@ hops from large places to the position of car@@ din@@ al but that Francis was &quot; full of sur@@ prises -- so we don &apos;t know who he &apos;ll name . &quot;
GM rec@@ alls some new pi@@ ck@@ up trucks in U.S. to fix se@@ at@@ backs
general Motors Co is rec@@ alling nearly 19@@ ,000 of its all @-@ new 2014 Ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ let Silver@@ ado and GM@@ C Sierra pi@@ ck@@ up trucks to repair a problem with the manual rec@@ lining se@@ at@@ back , according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday .
on some of the trucks , the front seats may have a defect in the rec@@ lining mechanism .
as a result , the se@@ at@@ backs fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restra@@ ints .
&quot; if the vehicle is struck from behind , the head restra@@ int may not properly protect occu@@ pan@@ ts , increasing the risk of injury , &quot; according to the notice posted on the National High@@ way Traff@@ ic Safety Administration website .
the rec@@ alled models were built between August 1 and September 10 .
GM &apos;s truck roll @-@ out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. autom@@ aker since its 2009 bankrupt@@ cy restructuring .
GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October .
N@@ HT@@ SA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16 @-@ day government sh@@ ut@@ down , which tem@@ pered auto sales growth in October .
sales of the Silver@@ ado and Sierra trucks , which were re@@ designed for the 2014 model year , were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year , GM said on Friday .
in October , GM sold 4@@ 2,@@ 6@@ 60 Silver@@ ado and 16@@ ,@@ 50@@ 3 Sierra pi@@ ck@@ up trucks .
GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .
an Obama vot@@ er &apos;s c@@ ry of desp@@ air
I voted for President Obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
he says Obama has had worthy efforts th@@ war@@ ted by G@@ OP ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism
ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism can &apos;t excuse Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are website wo@@ es , dr@@ one attacks
Obama &apos;s 2008 campaign mem@@ o@@ ir is a sad remin@@ der of what might have been
N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el P. Mor@@ ris is a second @-@ year student at Har@@ vard Medical School .
I &apos;m reading a terri@@ bly sad book these days .
it &apos;s a book that I thought would up@@ lift me during the dol@@ dru@@ ms of second @-@ year medical school , and rene@@ w in me a sense of hope .
it &apos;s called &quot; The Au@@ d@@ acity to W@@ in , &quot; and it &apos;s a mem@@ o@@ ir of Barack Obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign .
when I &apos;m finished with my patient write @-@ ups at night and get into bed , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away .
the election turned out to be a lands@@ li@@ de , and news anch@@ ors p@@ aus@@ ed to reflect on the historic nature of the hour .
my class@@ m@@ ates cri@@ ed with joy , and my parents saved every newspaper they could find .
a young team of vision@@ aries was headed for the White House , and the nation was ready for change .
during Obama &apos;s transition to office in 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating .
and then I close the book .
cutting to the present is a ru@@ de a@@ wak@@ ening , like sn@@ apping out of a dream .
it &apos;s hard to remember those days of optim@@ ism -- they seem a distant memory , a sad remin@@ der of opportunities gone by .
change indeed happened , in the years since I cast my first bal@@ lot .
it was simply nothing I could have imagin@@ ed .
I credit Obama with great and varied accompli@@ sh@@ ments , from the passage of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act to our military exit from Iraq , the end of &quot; don &apos;t ask don &apos;t tell , &quot; to the killing of O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden .
moreover , I believe that parti@@ san ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism has up@@ ended too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at Guant@@ an@@ amo Bay , among others .
but , after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and pe@@ ers , I &apos;ve reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide .
I &apos;ve reached a point of political desp@@ air .
Republi@@ can ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism cannot explain allowing the bu@@ gging of foreign leaders , nor having d@@ ron@@ es strike innocent children overseas .
it cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans , nor prosec@@ uting whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers who reveal government wron@@ g@@ doing .
it cannot account for assassin@@ ating An@@ war al @-@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without a trial , nor shir@@ king public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns .
it cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the Ni@@ x@@ on Administration . &quot;
and , most recently , it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act was signed into law .
I don &apos;t know if this is what I should have expected .
if , at 18 years old , I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradi@@ ct the political campaigns that prec@@ ede it .
obviously , elec@@ tive office isn &apos;t a predictable course , as the opposing political party and random events , such as the New@@ town mass@@ acre , will shape our public conversation .
yet , of all of the examples that I have listed above , they largely seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choosing .
that is what trou@@ bles me most of all .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was exc@@ ited by his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a conf@@ using and un@@ refined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions .
I felt that a second term for Obama , free from the pressures of future elections , would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long .
still , as Obama &apos;s approval rating s@@ ank below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder .
it makes me ye@@ ar@@ n for the many promises that disappeared .
this week I was reading the portion of the book descri@@ bing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania primary .
at a post @-@ mor@@ tem campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause .
&quot; I want us to get our mo@@ jo back , &quot; he said .
we &apos;ve got to remember who we are . &apos;
it &apos;s five years later , Mr. President , and I couldn &apos;t agree with you more .
the opinions expressed in this comm@@ entary are solely those of N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el Mor@@ ris .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims PM Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has conflict of interest over par@@ ental leave scheme
billi@@ on@@ aire MP C@@ live Pal@@ mer says Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over his par@@ ental leave scheme because his dau@@ gh@@ ters might get pregn@@ ant and benefit from it .
the mining magn@@ ate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict .
the Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are a@@ xed .
but Mr Pal@@ mer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s dau@@ gh@@ ters stood to personally benefit from policies .
&quot; he &apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid par@@ ental leave because if any of those dau@@ gh@@ ters get pregn@@ ant , he &apos;ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not , &quot; Mr Pal@@ mer said .
two months after the election , the electoral commission officially declared Mr Pal@@ mer the winner of the Sun@@ shine Coast seat of Fair@@ fax by 53 votes , after a re@@ count .
Mr Pal@@ mer called for over@@ hau@@ l of election counting to speed up the process .
Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s dau@@ gh@@ ters Fran@@ ces and Bri@@ d@@ get .
should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting ?
&quot; we need to have a better system , &quot; he said .
why is it that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have a system where you can walk in , pun@@ ch your details into a computer , vote immediately and have a result at 6.@@ 30 that night ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticised the use of pen@@ cils to mark ball@@ ots .
is it because they can ru@@ b out the result if someone doesn &apos;t like it ?
in this day and age having a pen@@ cil seems extraordinary .
the Ele@@ ct@@ oral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 , said his policies included an international airport for the Sun@@ shine Coast and he would take &quot; very seriously &quot; his new job .
public office is about public service .
&quot; we seek no reward , except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community , &quot; he said .
R@@ BS sus@@ pen@@ ds two fore@@ x traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation , in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining tra@@ ction .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including U@@ BS , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , Deutsche Bank and R@@ BS , have confirmed they are co @-@ operating with regulators in investigations into the world &apos;s largest financial market , where $ 5.@@ 3@@ t@@ n changes hands each day .
the two traders would be the first R@@ BS employees to be suspended in the wi@@ dening probe that e@@ cho@@ es the Lib@@ or inter@@ bank lending manipulation scandal .
the bank , which dec@@ lined to comment on the sus@@ pensions , confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators .
&quot; our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co @-@ operating fully with the F@@ CA and our other regulators , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation said that R@@ BS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regul@@ ator , the Financial Con@@ duc@@ t Authority , sent to and from a former tra@@ der .
this tra@@ der , Richard U@@ sher , left R@@ BS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of fore@@ x spot trading at JP@@ Morgan .
Roh@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of European spot trading at C@@ iti , went on leave this week , while Mat@@ t Gar@@ din@@ er , a former senior currencies tra@@ der at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ BS , was suspended by Standard Char@@ tered this week .
none of these traders have been accused of any wron@@ g@@ doing .
Mr U@@ sher &apos;s instant message group included ban@@ kers at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and C@@ iti@@ group , people close to the situation said .
U@@ BS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regul@@ ator , FIN@@ MA , said it was investig@@ ating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .
at least six authorities globally - the European Commission , FIN@@ MA , Switzerland &apos;s competition authority We@@ K@@ o , the F@@ CA , the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at alleg@@ ations that ban@@ kers col@@ lu@@ ded to move the currencies market .
H@@ S@@ BC , C@@ iti@@ group , JP@@ Morgan and Credit Su@@ isse have also launched internal prob@@ es or received requests for information from regulators , said people familiar with the situation .
banks are s@@ cour@@ ing through years &quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wron@@ g@@ doing .
news about the prob@@ es has r@@ att@@ led traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks &apos; trading units in past years but which has been challeng@@ ed this year as low vol@@ atility in currencies cuts opportunities for spec@@ ul@@ ators .
some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to mani@@ p@@ ulate , but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true .
a senior tra@@ der said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ mentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks &quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot; you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices . &quot;
the news came on the same day as Credit Su@@ isse announced it had dis@@ missed a tra@@ der at its London exchange tra@@ ded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6@@ m loss late last year .
the bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co @-@ operating with its regulators .
&quot; we are confident the tra@@ der acted alone and that the matter has been contained , &quot; Credit Su@@ isse said .
ho@@ arding on the Be@@ cht@@ le plot painted
a group belonging to the &quot; Schweizer Wi@@ ese &quot; citizen &apos;s initiative has given the ho@@ arding on the Be@@ cht@@ le plot on the spa promenade in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b a face @-@ lift .
in addition , they have cleaned and wi@@ dened the foot@@ path , a press release announced .
the planned covering of the di@@ la@@ pi@@ dated house to the rear of the plot was not permitted for safety reasons , as the premises were at risk of collap@@ sing .
Al@@ fred A@@ bel , who currently manages the site , arranged the &apos; face @-@ lift &apos; in cooperation with his colleague , Rein@@ hard Dom@@ ke , from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
before the citizen &apos;s initiative project , a banner with the message &quot; We are in favour &quot; was put up .
however , this did little to di@@ stra@@ ct the 20 or so members of the citizen &apos;s initiative from their project .
their motto , on the large bil@@ l@@ board stated &quot; We are against un@@ finished buildings . &quot;
in so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wi@@ ese - should the huge project one day fail .
chat@@ ting with many people passing by the &quot; construction site , &quot; it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town , although many have the same questions as the citizen &apos;s initiative regarding the scale of the planned project .
however , they are beginning to resi@@ gn themselves as the town continues to st@@ all in providing answers , said a statement from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
we have now been told that the public statements made by the Mayor are also having an impact .
in May , in the meeting of the Town Council , he said that he fe@@ ared for the outcome of the spa should the population vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wi@@ ese in the local referendum .
some appear ut@@ terly fri@@ gh@@ tened by it , others perc@@ ei@@ ve it as a &quot; b@@ lat@@ ant attempt to black@@ mail &quot; the population , continued the press release from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
the citizen &apos;s initiative than@@ ked those who don@@ ated paint and all those who l@@ ent a hand .
Ran@@ gni@@ ck s@@ col@@ ding for re@@ fs : man@@ e is no di@@ ver
as satisfied as R@@ al@@ f Ran@@ gni@@ ck is with the present winning form of the Austrian Bundes@@ lig@@ a table @-@ top@@ pers , Red Bul@@ l Salzburg , the S@@ porting Director of the &quot; Bul@@ ls &quot; expressed equal disappointment with the refer@@ ees .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous trend , with Man@@ e and Alan being du@@ b@@ bed as &apos; di@@ vers &apos; , &quot; he said at a press conference in Sal@@ burg on Thursday , in defence of the two tri@@ cky offensive players .
the most recent cause for Ran@@ gni@@ ck &apos;s criticism was the yellow card for Man@@ e at 3 : 0 against GrÃ¶@@ dig last Sunday , whereby the Sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese stri@@ ker was pen@@ alised for supposed play acting - admittedly this was not justified , as shown by TV foot@@ age .
&quot; a b@@ lat@@ ant wrong decision , &quot; comm@@ ented Ran@@ gni@@ ck , who referred to H@@ ark@@ am as being &quot; completely out of his depth . &quot;
H@@ ark@@ am also played &quot; his part &quot; in the escal@@ ation between Salzburg Co@@ ach Roger Schmidt and GrÃ¶@@ dig Trainer A@@ di H@@ Ã¼t@@ ter after the game .
he firmly defended his German comp@@ atri@@ ot : &quot; in each individual situation I would have beha@@ ved in the same way as Roger Schmidt . &quot;
Schmidt himself did not wish to have any contact with his colleagues after the sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ h with H@@ Ã¼t@@ ter .
I do not know why .
&quot; after all , I was the one who was insul@@ ted , &quot; emphasised the 46 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , with regard to the winning run , Ran@@ gni@@ ck s@@ ang his team &apos;s pra@@ ises .
&quot; there are only two words for it : really good , &quot; he stated .
there is not a lot you can critic@@ ise .
most of all , the manner in which the team is playing is impressive .
we must stay composed and keep it up .

Supreme Court uph@@ olds Obama health care law
in a major victory for the Obama administration , the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama &apos;s signature health care law is constitutional .
by a 5 @-@ 4 vote , the jus@@ tic@@ es ruled the Pati@@ ent Protection and Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act &apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the tax@@ ing power of the government .
chief Justice John Rober@@ ts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Jus@@ tic@@ es Sc@@ alia , Thomas , Ali@@ to and Kenne@@ dy dis@@ s@@ ented .
the court also up@@ held the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 page law , and further held that the health care law &apos;s requirement that states increase Medi@@ c@@ aid eli@@ gi@@ bility or else lose all federal Medi@@ c@@ aid funding is not un@@ constitu@@ tionally co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve .
the suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of In@@ dependent Business .
the law was vigor@@ ously opposed by each of the major Republi@@ can presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season , including pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tive nom@@ ine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
Norway : Norwe@@ gian village lights itself up with huge mir@@ rors
using huge mir@@ rors , the residents of a Norwe@@ gian village have brought light to their dre@@ ary valley .
due to the low level of sunshine , from autumn until spring the village of R@@ ju@@ kan in the V@@ est@@ f@@ j@@ ord valley normally langu@@ ishes in the sha@@ dows of the surrounding mountains .
with three gigan@@ tic mir@@ rors , each 45 metres t@@ all , a centuries @-@ old dream came true on Wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &apos; , ra@@ ved Mayor Stein@@ ar Ber@@ gs@@ land at the inau@@ gu@@ ral ceremony , tel@@ ev@@ ised by broad@@ ca@@ ster TV@@ 2 .
some valley residents lay back on sun lo@@ ung@@ ers , while others safely put on their s@@ ung@@ l@@ asses .
up until now , those hung@@ ry for sunshine in the winter had to travel to a nearby peak by cable car .
ten years ago , local artist Martin Ander@@ sen presented the proposal of direc@@ ting the sun into the valley using mir@@ rors .
however , this basic idea had been talked of in the location since 19@@ 13 .
after several years of debate , the Town Council finally approved the project , which cost 5 million kr@@ one ( around EUR 6@@ 15@@ ,000 ) .
a similar construction has provided sunshine to the Italian alpine resort of Vig@@ an@@ ella for a number of years .
the post is hardly ever emp@@ tied on Sun@@ days
&quot; many citizens will not yet have noticed that red d@@ ots indicating a Sunday post collection are still to be found on many post boxes in the town centre and its districts . however , if you read the small print on the yellow boxes operated by Post AG , you will quickly find out that the boxes are no longer emp@@ tied on Sun@@ days and holidays , &quot; announced the F@@ DP .
an inquiry by the F@@ DP confirmed this .
only the post boxes in front of the post office building at Ernst @-@ Ludwig @-@ StraÃe 36 and at Jak@@ ob @-@ MÃ¼ller @-@ StraÃe 1 in H@@ Ã¼t@@ ten@@ feld are still emp@@ tied .
whether there are still Sunday collections in Hof@@ heim and Rosen@@ garten is not addressed in the inquiry by the F@@ DP .
the F@@ DP spo@@ kes@@ person for social and youth @-@ related affairs , F@@ ritz RÃ¶@@ hr@@ en@@ beck wants to dig deeper into this .
the Sunday collection is an important postal service , especially in the case of scheduled post .
&quot; the company is radi@@ cally and un@@ accept@@ ably cutting back on this , despite the price increase for letters in January 2013 .
Thomas Bit@@ tner , Liberal Party Parliamentary Group and Muni@@ cip@@ al Association Chairman , is supporting his fellow group members : &quot; what anno@@ ys me , is the fact that the collection times have been changed or cancelled on the quiet here . &quot;
in so doing , the postal service is miles off the mark when it comes to public accessibility .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the districts of Neu@@ sch@@ lo@@ Ã and Rosen@@ garten must still be emp@@ tied on Sun@@ days , &quot; said Bit@@ tner and RÃ¶@@ hr@@ en@@ beck in un@@ ison .
it is also the case for the town centre that those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box with a Sunday collection on foot .
in the Town Parliament , RÃ¶@@ hr@@ en@@ beck asked whether the Town Council was planning discussions with the postal service regarding this matter .
Mayor E@@ rich Ma@@ ier responded that the postal service had not communic@@ ated with Lam@@ per@@ thei@@ m .
to the best of his knowledge , however , there is a Sunday collection in Hof@@ heim .
their party has spoken out in favour of privatis@@ ation .
&quot; decisions will then be made elsewhere , &quot; said Ma@@ ier .
Frankfurt parking fees to increase dramatically
parking in Frankfurt could soon be notic@@ e@@ ably more expensive .
the City Ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate today discussed a submission by the head of the department for transport , Stefan Maj@@ er ( Green Party ) .
according to the proposal , parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent .
this increase will not , however , be the result of raised prices , but rather the fact that time inter@@ val permitted by parking meters and ti@@ ck@@ eting machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .
the City Council must reach a decision on this in December .
the Ret@@ ail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry and Commerce believes that this is &quot; not a good idea . &quot;
the option of parking right outside their businesses is &quot; an advantage to smaller re@@ tail@@ ers that must not be under@@ estimated .. &quot;
the Verkehrs@@ club Deutschland ( German Traff@@ ic Club ) is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is &quot; completely appropriate and actually long over@@ due . &quot;
local public transport will also become more expensive .
Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt : quick moves take hosts by surprise
with a s@@ lender squ@@ ad , the T@@ SV Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt Herr@@ en I team ( M@@ en &apos;s First Team ) step@@ ped into the Schil@@ ler School G@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um in Re@@ ut@@ lingen to face T@@ G G@@ Ã¶n@@ n@@ ingen of the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b region .
the Al@@ b men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team .
however , it soon became evident that , due in part to their age , they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt team .
G@@ Ã¶n@@ n@@ ingen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well @-@ positioned offensive moves .
they repeatedly missed the passes and attacks coming clean@@ ly over the net from Simon Schen@@ k and E@@ du@@ ard Schulz and their blocking game was not up to scrat@@ ch .
clear vi@@ ct@@ ories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the su@@ peri@@ ority of the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt team in all areas .
faced with this overwhelming and match @-@ determining performance , the third set was won following a somewhat t@@ ame and spirit@@ less performance , for a final score of 3 : 0 ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 November , when they play TV Bai@@ ers@@ bron@@ n , who managed a clear victory in Nag@@ old , they will step onto the court to face a much stronger opponent .
T@@ SV Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt I : Domini@@ k B@@ Ã¤u@@ er@@ le , Y@@ anni@@ k BÃ¼@@ ch@@ le , Sebastian D@@ Ã¶l@@ ker , Feli@@ x P@@ Ã¤l@@ chen , Stefan R@@ Ã¤l@@ ler , Simon Schen@@ k and E@@ du@@ ard Schulz .
in the B Class , two teams from Bai@@ ers@@ bron@@ n and Fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt faced off in the Mur@@ g@@ tal@@ halle in Bai@@ ers@@ bron@@ n .
they produced a hard @-@ fought two @-@ hour match .
ner@@ ves on both sides , particularly when receiving the ball , resulted in errors and lost points ; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments over@@ eag@@ ern@@ ess saw potential points wa@@ sted .
however , in this even@@ ly matched game , the great physical effort of Mar@@ cus Blas@@ ut@@ to &apos;s T@@ SV team proved decisive in spite of tremendous commitment by both teams .
maintenance day at the small &apos; Eng@@ lÃ¤n@@ der@@ h@@ Ã¼t@@ te@@ &apos;
for what was then the fifth maintenance day in the follow @-@ up to the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hot@@ zen@@ wald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small Eng@@ lÃ¤n@@ der@@ hÃ¼@@ tte ( Engli@@ sh@@ man &apos;s Cot@@ tage ) in I@@ bach
following suggestions from the population , the of the valley in the area of the cot@@ tage was to be cle@@ ared , said Mayor Hel@@ mut Kaiser .
according to Kaiser , many hi@@ kers refer to this area as the show@@ piece of the Sch@@ lu@@ cht@@ enst@@ ei@@ g , where the landscape provides the ideal framework for fantastic views .
he than@@ ked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasised that the maintenance day is a suitable instrument through which to strengthen the connection between people and nature ,
he is offering every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .
at the same time as the tourist aspect , environmental aspects should also be taken into consideration .
this environmental aspect was explained by Frie@@ deri@@ ke Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it of the Department of Nature Con@@ servation of the Freiburg Regional Council , following the gre@@ eting by Regional Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Til@@ man Bol@@ la@@ cher , who had taken on the role of pat@@ ron and wished the campaign every success .
according to Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it , the tourist objective of the vision coinci@@ ded with the goal of preserving the now extremely over@@ grown old All@@ mend gra@@ zing past@@ ure , with its specific protected habit@@ ats , through its opening and connection to the still existing gra@@ zing land .
certain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ fli@@ es or gra@@ s@@ shop@@ pers , cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas .
they require these clear path@@ ways in order to preserve their species .
Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned bio@@ sphere area .
the current measures do not integrate seam@@ lessly into these plans .
a bio@@ sphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Un@@ esco status , and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the Life Project and the previous care days .
after the various statements , forest ran@@ ger Christoph W@@ eh@@ le and Life Project manager Cor@@ ne@@ lia Bis@@ cho@@ ff divided the hel@@ pers into groups .
the larger trees had been cut down in advance , although forest tra@@ ctors were on @-@ call if required .
one group of hel@@ pers were to take care of the cle@@ arance of j@@ uni@@ per bus@@ hes and the maintenance of a dry stone wall .
the objective was to create a clear view at the view@@ point .
L@@ Ã¶ff@@ ingen : KÃ¶@@ pf@@ ler still the only candidate
information online : although L@@ Ã¶ff@@ ingen , the small town of Ba@@ ar , with its 7,@@ 5@@ 14 residents , can be described as having an int@@ act infrastructure , forward @-@ looking school , youth and senior citizens policies and its own municipal energy companies , thus far no @-@ one has registered as a second may@@ oral candidate .
so far , the only candidate to succeed Mayor Nor@@ bert Bru@@ gger , who is no longer running on account of his age , is 46 @-@ year @-@ old ban@@ ker and business econom@@ ist Di@@ eter KÃ¶@@ pf@@ ler from L@@ Ã¶ff@@ ingen .
the deadline for applications is Monday 11 November , at 6 : 00 p.m.
Google , Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i su@@ ed over Nor@@ tel patents
the group that own@@ s thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents filed a bar@@ rage of patent law@@ suits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google , the company it out@@ bid in the Nor@@ tel bankrupt@@ cy auction .
Rock@@ star , the con@@ sortium that bought the Nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , su@@ ed Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HT@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas .
Rock@@ star is jointly owned by Apple , Microsoft , Black@@ berry , Ericsson and Sony .
Google is accused of inf@@ ring@@ ing seven patents .
the patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising , the law@@ suit said , which is the core of Google &apos;s search business .
representatives for Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , HT@@ C and Rock@@ star could not immediately be reached .
Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and HT@@ C all manufacture phones that operate on Google &apos;s Andro@@ id operating system , which compet@@ es fi@@ erc@@ ely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products .
in 2011 Google placed an initial $ 900 million bid for Nor@@ tel &apos;s patents .
Google increased its bid several times , ultimately offering as much as $ 4.@@ 4 billion .
after losing out to Rock@@ star on the Nor@@ tel patents , Google went on to acquire Motor@@ ola Mo@@ bility for $ 12.@@ 5 billion , a deal driven partly by Motor@@ ola &apos;s library of patents .
&quot; despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents @-@ in @-@ suit at auction , Google has inf@@ ring@@ ed and continues to infrin@@ ge , &quot; the law@@ suit said .
Rock@@ star is seeking increased damages against Google , as it claims Google &apos;s patent infringement is will@@ ful , according to the complaint .
Egypt swe@@ ars in first freely elected president
Moh@@ amed Mor@@ si takes the o@@ ath of office but his day of trium@@ ph is unlikely to mark end of political stri@@ fe in Egypt .
Islam@@ ist Moh@@ amed Mor@@ si promised a &quot; new Egypt &quot; as he took the o@@ ath of office to become the country &apos;s first freely elected president , succe@@ eding Ho@@ sn@@ i Mu@@ bar@@ ak who was ou@@ sted 16 months ago .
at his inau@@ gu@@ ration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Mor@@ si also became the Arab world &apos;s first freely elected Islam@@ ist president and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ arch@@ y some 60 years ago .
he took the o@@ ath before the court &apos;s 18 black @-@ ro@@ bed judges in its Ni@@ le @-@ side seat built to re@@ semble an ancient Egyptian temple .
&quot; we asp@@ ire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public , &quot; Mor@@ si said during a sol@@ em@@ n ceremony shown live on state television .
&quot; today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said Mor@@ si , a 60 @-@ year @-@ old US @-@ trained engineer from the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood , a fundament@@ alist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inc@@ eption as an out@@ la@@ wed organisation har@@ sh@@ ly targeted by successive governments .
hundreds of soldiers and poli@@ c@@ emen gu@@ arded the building as Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11@@ am local time in a small motor@@ c@@ ade .
only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to che@@ er the new president and , in a departure from the presidential p@@ om@@ p of the Mu@@ bar@@ ak years , traffic was only briefly hal@@ ted to allow his motor@@ c@@ ade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern sub@@ ur@@ bs .
deri@@ ded as the Bro@@ ther@@ hood &apos;s un@@ char@@ ism@@ atic &quot; spare ty@@ re , &quot; his personal pre@@ stige has sur@@ ged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islam@@ ists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 u@@ pr@@ ising against the authoritarian Mu@@ bar@@ ak .
&quot; Egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; Mor@@ si , wearing a blue business suit and a red tie , told the judges in the wood @-@ pan@@ elled chamber where he took the o@@ ath of office .
Mor@@ si later trav@@ elled to Cairo University where he was to make his inau@@ gu@@ ration address .
he was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national an@@ them as he stood to attention .
military rul@@ er Fi@@ eld Mar@@ sh@@ al Hussein Tan@@ ta@@ wi was in attendance .
his arrival was gre@@ eted with chan@@ ts of , &quot; The army and the people are one hand , &quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university &apos;s main le@@ cture room .
established in 19@@ 08 as a bas@@ tion of secular education , Cairo University later became a stron@@ gh@@ old of Islam@@ ist student groups in the 1970s .
Mor@@ si took a symbolic o@@ ath on Friday in T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square , birth@@ place of the u@@ pr@@ ising that ended Mu@@ bar@@ ak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and vo@@ wed to rec@@ la@@ im presidential powers stri@@ pped from his office by the military council that took over from the ou@@ sted leader .
but by agreeing to take the official o@@ ath before the court , rather than before parliament as is custom@@ ary , he is bo@@ wing to the military &apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue .
Mor@@ si &apos;s speech in T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square was filled with dramatic popu@@ list gest@@ ures .
Fal@@ ken@@ berg club makes for two wonderful evenings .

worker falls from lad@@ der : seriously injured
on Thursday , a 51 @-@ year @-@ old worker in E@@ g@@ gel@@ s@@ berg fell from a lad@@ der while replacing a broken external sensor and was seriously injured .
the man from Lam@@ pre@@ cht@@ sh@@ au@@ sen wanted to replace a broken heating sensor on the external fac@@ ade of a guest house .
as he was climbing the lad@@ der , which was re@@ sting on the roof gut@@ tering , it sli@@ pped away and the man fell onto the concrete below .
he suffered serious inju@@ ries and was taken by the &quot; Christop@@ hor@@ us 6 &quot; rescue helicopter to the Salzburg Regional Hospital .
rap@@ ist in South Africa : two life sentences
nine months after the brutal rap@@ e and mu@@ tilation of a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl in South Africa , the perpet@@ r@@ ator was condemned to two life sentences on Friday .
this was reported by broad@@ ca@@ ster S@@ AB@@ C .
the victim later died as a result of the serious inju@@ ries .
Johannes Kan@@ a had already been found guilty of the crime at the start of the week .
the crime had caused nation@@ wide hor@@ ror .
the then 21 @-@ year @-@ old had rap@@ ed an@@ ene Boo@@ y@@ sen in February in an industrial estate in Bre@@ das@@ dor@@ p , near Cap@@ et@@ own .
for 14 hours , doctors batt@@ led to save the life of the victim , ultimately in v@@ ain .
the sight of the young girl was so horri@@ fic that the car@@ ers and nur@@ sing staff required psychological support .
during the trial , Kan@@ a admitted to having been in a bar with Boo@@ y@@ sen on the night of the attack .
he also admitted to be@@ ating and rap@@ ing her , however he denied being responsible for the death of the girl .
the police had initially assumed that there were multiple attack@@ ers , however , they released two susp@@ ects from cu@@ sto@@ dy as the evidence against them was insufficient .
during the proceedings the public pro@@ secution also emphasised that they were convinced that Kan@@ a was alone at the time of the attack .
rap@@ es are almost part of everyday life in South Africa : there are around 6@@ 4@@ ,000 reports of sexual ass@@ ault every year .
this is almost ten times as many as in Germany , although with a population of 82 million people , Germany has a much higher number of residents than South Africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in South Africa , however , estimate the number of un@@ reported cases of sexual ass@@ ault to be 10 @-@ 25 times as high .
J@@ umb@@ o visits the home of Black Forest ham
J@@ umb@@ o on the search for the &quot; world &apos;s best ham &quot; : for the TV programme &quot; Galileo , &quot; the Pro@@ 7 star visited Bon@@ n@@ dorf .
the present@@ er established one thing right from the outset : the most important thing when it comes to ham are the legs of por@@ k - tur@@ bo f@@ atten@@ ing does not provide a good basis for this .
can ham bought in a super@@ market be as good as a quality product ?
Ul@@ i , bo@@ ss of the large ham factory in Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , explained to J@@ umb@@ o how the Bon@@ n@@ dorf company , &quot; Ad@@ ler , &quot; operates .
&quot; Germany &apos;s most @-@ loved ham , &quot; said J@@ umb@@ o , presenting the Black Forest ham .
he could only enter the factory when wearing hair protection and a white coat .
J@@ umb@@ o also had to first disin@@ f@@ ect his hands before he could reach for the mic@@ roph@@ one .
J@@ umb@@ o seen getting something to keep him going at a fast food restaurant in Wald@@ shut
&quot; here they work with huge quantities , &quot; comm@@ ented the television producers , aston@@ ished by the mass production of Black Forest ham .
16@@ ,000 jo@@ ints of meat per week speak for themselves .
weight , fat content and colour : Ul@@ i explained what was required for the best quality .
the majority of the pig@@ s are slau@@ gh@@ tered at six months old .
television with standards ?
even specific details such as the p@@ H value of the meat play a role .
the dar@@ ker the meat , the higher the p@@ H value .
&quot; I would be curious what would happen if you were to measure Rober@@ to Blan@@ co , &quot; said J@@ umb@@ o cy@@ ni@@ cally .
here the standard of private television production is presented in its pu@@ rest form .
nonetheless , it is worth watching .
the viewer sees that jo@@ ints are still car@@ ved by hand .
after all : black Forest ham traditionally arri@@ ves on the shel@@ f bon@@ eless .
the secret of the ham is the mix of her@@ bs combined with salt .
the appearance of the smoking tower and fur@@ n@@ ace remind J@@ umb@@ o of a sub@@ marine .
the tri@@ ck : here fi@@ r branches in the smo@@ ker provide the special flav@@ our of Black Forest ham .
after 20 days in the smoke , the ham is finally almost black .
&quot; and now the sli@@ ce will disappear inside J@@ umb@@ o , &quot; he said , announ@@ cing his sam@@ pling of the product .
&quot; that is really delicious , &quot; said the TV star in conclusion .
all those involved will be happy with that evaluation .
thought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight Centre seem to be bu@@ cking the trend .
the company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holi@@ day@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
the travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $ 3@@ 25 million and $ 3@@ 40 million , compared with the $ 30@@ 5 million to $ 3@@ 15 million it previously forecast .
if the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $ 29@@ 0.@@ 4 million profit it achieved in 2011 / 12 .
managing director Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner said F@@ light Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non @-@ business travel .
&quot; year @-@ to @-@ date , our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full @-@ year earnings before interest and tax contributions , &quot; he said .
this includes Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically our largest profit gener@@ ators .
in Australia the leisure business re@@ bound@@ ed during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market .
similarly in the UK , F@@ light Centre &apos;s leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less .
its US business had recover@@ ed its losses during its seas@@ on@@ ally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecu@@ tive full year profit .
flight Centre shares were up 3@@ c at $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
schools urged to focus more on ma@@ ths , sp@@ elling and gram@@ mar
English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are play , a 19th century novel , Roman@@ tic po@@ etry and contemporary British fiction from 19@@ 14 onwards .
the ex@@ am will also feature &quot; un@@ seen texts &quot; to encourage wider reading ;
a combined English literature and language course will be scra@@ pped .
from 2015 , pupils will be required to take a stand@@ alone G@@ C@@ SE in language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .
the Department for Education is due to release the new sy@@ ll@@ abuses in English and ma@@ ths tomorrow - the first subjects to under@@ go a radical over@@ hau@@ l .
it will make changes in other core subjects next year .
in a separate move , O@@ f@@ qu@@ al , the exam@@ s regul@@ ator , will un@@ v@@ eil a sha@@ ke @-@ up of the structure of G@@ C@@ SE@@ s , with a new gra@@ ding system and less cour@@ se@@ work .
speaking in the summer , Michael Go@@ ve , the Education Secretary , said there was a &quot; widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; insi@@ sting G@@ C@@ SE@@ s would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
studies show that English schools devote less time to ma@@ ths - 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries .
by comparison , Australian schools provide an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and pupils do around 13@@ 8 hours in Singapore .
while there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to ma@@ ths , Co@@ alition sources said the extensive ma@@ ths G@@ C@@ SE - combined with more weigh@@ ting for the subject in le@@ ague tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching .
the sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us will place a greater focus on &quot; real world problems , &quot; including financial mathemati@@ cs .
beautiful animals and delicious tar@@ ts enti@@ ce
the most beautiful rab@@ bits of various bre@@ eds and colour@@ ings will be presented at the District Exhibition this weekend in the community centre .
the evalu@@ ations were already made on Thursday .

S@@ AL@@ EM : Joh@@ anna Rah@@ ner at the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ c@@ ussion Forum
at the next E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ c@@ ussion Forum on Monday 21 October , in the Neues Museum des Sch@@ losses ( New Castle Museum ) , the focus will be on the topic of &quot; To hell with H@@ ell - The@@ ological refle@@ ctions on how we now approach the notion of end times . &quot;
the speaker will be Joh@@ anna Rah@@ ner .
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ c@@ ussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Prote@@ stant churches in Sal@@ em , the Sal@@ em Castle and the Lake Con@@ stance District Cultural Office .
at the forum , Joh@@ anna Rah@@ ner wants to address the question of how people today view the &quot; end times &quot; after death .
while people in past centuries were over@@ ly conscious of it , focusing on the pictures of heaven and hell &quot; that up until now have defined our ideas , &quot; contemporary prop@@ he@@ tic teaching on the hope of consum@@ mation is characterised more by a certain b@@ ash@@ fulness , or even spee@@ ch@@ less@@ ness .
&quot; the greater hope has been well and truly cast out of Christians by religious critics , &quot; said the speaker .
they have &quot; provided us with so many question marks , that we seem to have lost our exc@@ lam@@ ation marks . &quot;
Joh@@ anna Rah@@ ner continued : &quot; however , the crucial challenge to this remains fear of death . &quot;
associated with this is the matter of that lon@@ ging , &quot; that dreams that everything will be good at the end . &quot;
Joh@@ anna Rah@@ ner , born in 1962 in Baden @-@ Baden , studied Catholic the@@ ology and bi@@ ology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert Ludwig &apos;s University in Freiburg .
in 1997 she gradu@@ ated as a doctor of the@@ ology , also in Freiburg .
a post @-@ do@@ ct@@ oral lec@@ turing qualification in fundamental the@@ ology and ec@@ umen@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the West@@ f@@ ali@@ an Wilhelm &apos;s University .
since 2010 , Joh@@ anna Rah@@ ner has occupied a Chair for System@@ atic The@@ ology in the Institute for Catholic The@@ ology at the University of Kas@@ sel .
Geis@@ lingen : more than 100 young Catho@@ lics from Kl@@ einer Heu@@ berg stand together in the confirmation of their profession of faith
in two services , 101 15 and 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from the Am Kl@@ einen Heu@@ berg past@@ oral care unit were confirmed .
in the morning , the service was accompanied by the Lau@@ dat@@ o @-@ S@@ i Group , while the afternoon service featured &apos; The Spirit &apos; youth cho@@ ir .
upon receiving the confirmation sac@@ ra@@ ment , the young people accepted their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit .
over recent months those being confirmed , under the direction of De@@ acon R@@ einer D@@ eh@@ ner and the assistance of several church members , have been preparing for the special day .
in various projects , they learned of the different tasks involved in Christian church life and attended the Youth Day in Unter@@ ma@@ cht@@ al together .
I@@ ll@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike race enth@@ uses participants
in fantastic weather , 2@@ 14 cycli@@ sts came to I@@ ll@@ men@@ see to take on the circuit , over the hills and around the lake .
this was announced by Ulrich Kno@@ bel of the organising I@@ ll@@ men@@ see Sports Club .
among the participants there were also numerous am@@ ateur cycli@@ sts who wanted the chance to practice their ho@@ b@@ by in a competitive environment , in particular over the short distance of 15 kilometres with a 300 metre climb .
two top @-@ class junior cycli@@ sts were also in the starting line @-@ up for the competition : Feli@@ x Ba@@ der from Bad Wald@@ see and Pas@@ cal Tre@@ u@@ bel from A@@ ach @-@ Linz came with the recommendation of having achieved good positions at the German Cham@@ pion@@ ships .
the pair managed to break away from the field in keeping with expectations .
as was the case the previous year , Feli@@ x Ba@@ der managed to hold on to a small lead right to the end and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance race
once again , Pas@@ cal Tre@@ u@@ bel took second place .
in the ladies &apos; race it was Ther@@ esa Du@@ elli of Team Alb@@ trau@@ m who managed to take top place on the po@@ dium .
in second and third places were Anne A@@ del from I@@ ll@@ men@@ see and Leon@@ ie T@@ reiber from O@@ win@@ gen .
the increasing number of riders that live or work in the area is a fantastic development .
and it was not only about top performance - the entire range of athle@@ tic ability was represented .
participants &apos; ages were also wide @-@ ranging , with the young@@ est star@@ ters at ten years old up to the oldest at over 70 .
this year , there were even more absolute top athletes at the starting line for the main race .
four cycli@@ sts managed to break away from the top regional rac@@ ers .
these included Phili@@ pp Pan@@ ger@@ l , a semi @-@ professional mountain bi@@ ker from the Black Tus@@ k Racing Team .
together with a team mate , Pan@@ ger@@ l has already twice been crow@@ ned World Champion in the 12 @-@ hour race .
this year he became European Champion in this special discipline .
also competing was Rol@@ and B@@ aller@@ st@@ edt , who has already claimed two German du@@ ath@@ lon cham@@ pion@@ ships .
after 45 kilometres and a climb of 900 metres , the leading riders were neck and neck on the final straight in front of the Dre@@ i @-@ Se@@ en @-@ Hall .
Pan@@ ger@@ l sp@@ ed over the finish line in first place .
only one second later , the experienced B@@ aller@@ st@@ edt managed to take second place in the overall stand@@ ings .
Her@@ mann and War@@ th@@ mann then reached the finish line simultaneously to take joint third in the overall stand@@ ings .
in the ladies &apos; race , Christi@@ ane Coh@@ s@@ mann achieved the fastest time in the main race .
Are@@ ane B@@ ler@@ sch from Bin@@ zw@@ an@@ gen took second place , ahead of Nat@@ asch@@ a Werner from Stuttgart .
athletes and assi@@ stants seemed very satisfied with the smooth and well @-@ organised running of the event .
tre@@ kking through mud , rivers and jung@@ le to provide free medical care
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cam@@ ero@@ on
B@@ wel@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
there aren &apos;t many doctors in the west African country ; just one for every 5,000 people
cast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 CN@@ N Her@@ oes of 2013 .
you can vote for him , or any of the other top 10 Her@@ oes , to be CN@@ N Her@@ o of the Year .
that person will receive $ 25@@ 0@@ ,000 to continue their extraordinary work .
for 21 years , Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le wat@@ ched his ill father sli@@ p in and out of consciousness , traveling to hospitals that weren &apos;t equipped to help him .
J@@ ame@@ f B@@ wel@@ le was injured in a 1981 car accident near Y@@ ao@@ unde , Cam@@ ero@@ on &apos;s capital .
he suffered only a broken arm at first , but an infection developed and spread to his brain , creating a hem@@ atom@@ a that would affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; there were no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in Cam@@ ero@@ on , &quot; Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le said .
we would have taken him out of Cam@@ ero@@ on if we had the money .
instead , B@@ wel@@ le spent years es@@ cor@@ ting his father to over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , getting whatever treatment they could get .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
you can leave home at 5 a.m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
there are a lot of patients .
some people can die because they are waiting .
the situation has@@ n &apos;t changed much since B@@ wel@@ le &apos;s father passed away in 2002 .
in Cam@@ ero@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
for comparison &apos;s sake , the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 4@@ 13 people .
and even if they could see a physi@@ cian , many Cam@@ ero@@ oni@@ ans couldn &apos;t afford it .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three @-@ quarters of the country &apos;s health @-@ care spending is private .
&quot; the only problem they have is poverty , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
and with poverty , they cannot enjoy their life .
seeing his father and so many of his country@@ men suffer , B@@ wel@@ le was determined to do something about it .
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies in the past year .
he became a doctor himself , working as a v@@ as@@ cular sur@@ ge@@ on in Y@@ ao@@ unde &apos;s Central Hospital .
and he started a non@@ profit , AS@@ CO@@ V@@ IM@@ E , that tra@@ vels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32@@ ,000 people .
almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people j@@ am into v@@ ans , tie medical supplies to the ro@@ o@@ fs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need .
their luck doesn &apos;t always hold out .
they &apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .
but when they arrive , they receive a true her@@ oes &apos; welcome : a fe@@ ast , singing and dancing , and the best accommodations the community can offer .
in these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebration , and B@@ wel@@ le -- with his big smile and bound@@ less energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun .
the next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients .
&quot; we are receiving 500 people in each trip , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
they are coming from 60 kilometers around the village , and they &apos;re coming on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics provides a variety of medical care .
many people are treated for malaria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutrition , di@@ abetes , par@@ as@@ ites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others might receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , a pair of don@@ ated e@@ ye@@ gl@@ asses or free birth certificates -- documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many im@@ pover@@ ished families simply can &apos;t afford .
in the evenings , the team will do simple sur@@ ger@@ ies with local an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
operations are usually done in a scho@@ ol@@ house , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .
with the group &apos;s generator lighting the operating room and s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ing equipment , B@@ wel@@ le and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .
it &apos;s a back@@ breaking pace , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .
&quot; they are be@@ ating dru@@ ms all night to keep us a@@ wake and continue our work , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
on Sunday , the team heads back to the city , tired but proud of their work .
the group -- a mix of Cam@@ ero@@ onian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help .
one man explained that the free her@@ nia surgery he &apos;d received will allow him to work again .
&quot; this will change my future with my family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to holding these weekend clin@@ ics and working as a hospital sur@@ ge@@ on , B@@ wel@@ le also works nights at private medical clin@@ ics around Y@@ ao@@ unde .
it &apos;s this second job , he said , that funds about 60 % of his non@@ profit ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&quot; I &apos;m not sure when he sle@@ eps , &quot; said K@@ atie O &apos;@@ M@@ alley , a second @-@ year medical student from Dre@@ xel University in Phi@@ la@@ del@@ phi@@ a and volunte@@ er with B@@ wel@@ le &apos;s group .
he is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students such as O &apos;@@ M@@ alley , who come from the United States and Europe to join B@@ wel@@ le on his missions , it &apos;s a hands @-@ on opportunity they &apos;d never get at home .
&quot; we &apos;ve been able to sc@@ ru@@ b in on sur@@ ger@@ ies where we help blo@@ t blood away or hold tools for Dr. B@@ wel@@ le , &quot; O &apos;@@ M@@ alley said .
that &apos;s not something you &apos;d ever get to do in America as a second @-@ year medical student .
the student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cam@@ ero@@ on , often arriving with don@@ ated medical supplies .
but once they arrive in Y@@ ao@@ unde , their board , transportation and instruction are covered by B@@ wel@@ le .
&quot; he &apos;s a her@@ o , without a doubt , &quot; O &apos;@@ M@@ alley said .
he gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the Cam@@ ero@@ on people is ever@@ lasting .
for B@@ wel@@ le , the near @-@ constant work@@ load isn &apos;t a hard@@ ship .
helping others live happi@@ er lives , fulfilling a promise he made to his father , is something that brings him great joy .
&quot; I am so happy when I am doing this work , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
and I think about my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
to make people lau@@ gh , to reduce the pain , that &apos;s why I &apos;m doing this .

ma@@ stering the struggle to perfec@@ tion .
the role of Santiago , the old man in Hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s novel &quot; The Old Man and the Sea , &quot; is perfectly suited to Hor@@ st Jan@@ son .
Jan@@ son is an old hand himself when it comes to his profession , the art of acting .
the old man , Santiago , is the best there is when it comes to fishing .
as such , the pair complement one another super@@ bly .
you almost think that you can see the fol@@ ds in the old man &apos;s neck , of which young fisher@@ man Man@@ olo speaks .
when Santiago s@@ its arch@@ ed over on the chair , tired of life , this is a genuine emo@@ tion for Jan@@ son .
furthermore , the role of the old fisher@@ man is a character role , through and through , which Jan@@ son masters excell@@ ently .
Hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a coura@@ geous man who doesn &apos;t give up and who ultimately wins the battle against the fish as a result of his knowledge and his strong will .
for long periods , Jan@@ son is the only per@@ former on the stage .
he manages to focus the audience &apos;s attention on himself , with the result that his mon@@ olo@@ gues never become bor@@ ing , not even for just a moment .
his efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that members of the audience forget that the sea in question consists merely of water bot@@ tles , illum@@ inated in blue .
director J@@ ens Has@@ sel@@ mann has the old man in the boat perform in front of F@@ is@@ cher@@ dorf .
during the course of the performance he has the respective active scene illum@@ inated . Santiago &apos;s cabin and the bar of singer Marie @-@ Lu@@ ise Gun@@ st , who sings of the Cuban lifestyle , with your songs and beautiful voice .
the four musicians accompany with Cuban rhyth@@ ms and guests at the bar at the same time .
tourism : des@@ cent to the Rom@@ ans
bene@@ ath Cologne , a se@@ wage channel from Roman times , measuring around 120 metres in length , has been preserved .
anyone visiting Cologne cannot miss the cathedral .
the two towers , measuring around 15@@ 7 metres , extend into the heav@@ ens , making it Europe &apos;s second t@@ all@@ est church building .
however , only a few visitors who mar@@ vel at the two or@@ n@@ ate church towers realise that there is much to discover bene@@ ath the cathedral .
Ra@@ iner Schul@@ ze is an expert when it comes to the Cologne under@@ world .
the meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre , right at the cathedral .
the tour begins in a somewhat un@@ spectacular fashion : &quot; we begin in the underground car park , &quot; says Schul@@ ze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car @-@ friendly city , and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too t@@ all .
the majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hur@@ ry past the Roman re@@ lics and simply drop off their car .
however , anyone who takes a closer look on parking level D@@ 2 will discover an archaeological site , c@@ ord@@ oned off by metal rail@@ ings .
ruins measuring five metres t@@ all , made from stones around the size of the palm of your hand , are waiting to be discovered .
&quot; these are rem@@ n@@ ants of the Roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century A.@@ D , &quot; explains Schul@@ ze .
before returning to day@@ light , Schul@@ ze has participants take a g@@ lance into a dark , 15 @-@ metre sha@@ ft on the upper parking level .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which is barely noticed at all these days .
the next stop on the tour is the Pra@@ et@@ orium , where participants once again desc@@ end to the dep@@ ths .
here we find the residence of what was once the most powerful man to the north of the Alps , the Pra@@ et@@ or of the C@@ CA@@ A .
one visitor wants to know what C@@ CA@@ A means .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; Col@@ onia Clau@@ dia Ar@@ a Agri@@ pp@@ inen@@ si@@ um , &quot; which is basically amounts to &quot; City under Roman Law and City of the Agri@@ pp@@ ini@@ ans , founded under Emperor Clau@@ di@@ us at the Site of the Alt@@ ars for the Imperial Cul@@ t . &quot;
and the Pra@@ et@@ orium refers to the former Govern@@ or &apos;s Palace and the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .
from the exhibition vesti@@ bu@@ le , a tunnel leads to the preserved Roman se@@ wer , measuring around 120 metres in length .
&quot; if you want you can take a peaceful stroll along a section of the so @-@ called Clo@@ aca Maxim@@ a , &quot; says Schul@@ ze , encouraging the guests .
Schul@@ ze has one more surprise .
once he has collected the key from the information desk , he leads the group to a 16 @-@ metre , accessible sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the Mik@@ we , a rit@@ ual Jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the Jewish con@@ gre@@ gation built their bath deep into the ground in order to reach the ground@@ water essential for rit@@ ual washing .
to this day the differing water levels caused by the varying levels of the Rhine can be read at the lower end of the Mik@@ we , the origins of which trace back to the eigh@@ th century .
the Mik@@ we is to form part of an archaeological area at the Town Hall Square , on which construction work is set to begin shortly .
however , it will be a few years before it is complete .
leg almost h@@ ack@@ ed off : ro@@ cker re@@ trial
a bloo@@ dy attack within the &apos; Ro@@ cker &apos; scene is to be re @-@ investigated after more than four years .
proceedings for attempted murder , gri@@ ev@@ ous bo@@ di@@ ly harm and material damage , brought against two 30 @-@ year @-@ olds have begun before the Frankfurt District Court .
they are being accompanied by strict security precau@@ tions .
the accused initially remained silent .
they are said to have been active within the Ro@@ cker scene and to have at the time belon@@ ged to the ban@@ di@@ dos .
the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor accused them of having stab@@ bed and be@@ aten three men in a car in Fin@@ ow@@ furt , together with unknown accompli@@ ces .
all the victims were seriously injured , with one man almost losing a leg .
the victims were said to have belon@@ ged to the competing gang , the H@@ ell &apos;s Angel@@ s .
one is said to have been a high @-@ ranking member from Berlin .
it seems that the attack was prec@@ eded by a car ch@@ ase involving several cars .
according to accus@@ ations , this was part of a tur@@ f war and represented a demonstration of power .
the two accused were acqu@@ it@@ ted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012 .
at the time , a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloo@@ dy feu@@ d .
the as@@ sail@@ ants had worn mas@@ ks and had not been recognised .
the Federal Supreme Court repe@@ aled the verdi@@ ct following an appeal by the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office and referred the case back to the District Court for a re @-@ trial .
one of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another off@@ ence .
proceedings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the crime .
the police inspec@@ tor responsible at the time was invited as a witness .
the central point of focus was on mobile phone convers@@ ations between the accused and third parties , which the police had inter@@ cep@@ ted .
what makes things difficult is that Ro@@ ckers almost always observe what they consider to be complete silence appearing before the court - they say absolutely nothing .
this also applies in the case of the victims .
in the first trial , only one of the victims spoke out .
when asked , Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor Stefan Gol@@ fier of the Frankfurt ( O@@ der ) Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial .
a further eleven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial .
the thro@@ wa@@ way society does not think
the night was long , the music loud and the atmosphere good , but at some point everyone has to go home .
except : in the stom@@ ach@@ s of those in the passenger and back seats , hunger strikes .
of course , this may be down to the odd cocktail or glass of bub@@ bly !
so what could be more natural than to cas@@ ually pull into the next drive @-@ through to pick yourself up a little treat ?
I admit , I am right with you with it comes to pi@@ cking up some fast food late at night , or early in the morning as the case may be .
a few chips , a co@@ ke , a burger - and then straight home and into bed !
however , on the way home the clear differences between me and other hung@@ ry clu@@ b@@ bers become evident .
what is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window ? !
at the weekend in particular , dis@@ car@@ ded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks .
&quot; why is this ? &quot; I ask myself .
are the people too stu@@ pid to take their bags home or throw them into the nearest rub@@ b@@ ish bin ?
after all , waste paper does more than spo@@ il the landscape .
bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers , thus causing accidents .
however , the so @-@ called &quot; thro@@ wa@@ way society &quot; does not think about such things . they probably do not even know what the term even means .
if you are often out and about in the evening , more often than not with several people in the car , you will know what a back seat can look like after having parti@@ ed through the night : clothes , bot@@ tles and other rub@@ b@@ ish begin to pi@@ le up .
a few bags won &apos;t make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no @-@ one wants to tra@@ mp@@ le through other peoples &apos; le@@ f@@ to@@ ver food .
I can see the day coming when towns and municip@@ alities will get fed up cle@@ aring up - and the fast food chains will have to operate a deposit scheme for their bags .
Obama &apos;s Health Care Wal@@ k B@@ ack
am@@ id a fire@@ storm of criticism , President Obama yesterday wal@@ ked back his oft @-@ repeated , un@@ ambiguous promise that &quot; if you like your health plan , you can keep it . &quot;
with hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notic@@ es from their providers , Republi@@ cans have sl@@ amm@@ ed the president in recent days for misleading the American public .
yesterday , Obama t@@ weak@@ ed his original ple@@ dge .
&quot; for the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works , you can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in Boston .
addressing what he called the &quot; fl@@ ur@@ ry in the news &quot; about the cancell@@ ations , Obama urged Americans receiving these notic@@ es to shop for new coverage in the market@@ place .
most people are going to be able to get better , comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projec@@ ted .
&quot; you &apos;re going to get a better deal , &quot; he said .
the administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn &apos;t meet the new standards required under the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act .
&quot; let me say directly to these Americans : you deserve better , &quot; Se@@ be@@ li@@ us said in testim@@ ony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington .
Se@@ be@@ li@@ us , who is over@@ seeing implementation of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act , said the launch of the online market@@ place has gone &quot; mis@@ er@@ ably &quot; since October .
&quot; I am as frustr@@ ated and an@@ gr@@ y as anyone , &quot; she said .
I am e@@ ager to earn your confidence back .
an ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated Se@@ be@@ li@@ us ut@@ tered that phrase , caught by a hot mic , to an ai@@ de se@@ ated behind her at yesterday &apos;s House hearing following a conten@@ tious exchange with Rep@@ . Bil@@ ly Long , R @-@ M@@ o . , over whether she should be required to en@@ roll in Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
more than three hours into the hearing , Long repeatedly pressed Se@@ be@@ li@@ us on why the &quot; architect &quot; of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act has not volun@@ t@@ arily for@@ gone government @-@ sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through He@@ al@@ th@@ C@@ are@@ .@@ go@@ v , which she is now pit@@ ching to millions of Americans .
the government in Jerusalem fails to confirm an attack on the Syrian air@@ force base
on Thursday , an American government official , who wished to remain anonymous , made a statement to American news broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N , stating that Israeli figh@@ ter planes had attacked an air@@ force base in the Syrian town of Lat@@ akia the day before .
the target was &quot; missi@@ les and related equipment , &quot; which the Israeli government fe@@ ared were intended for the Leban@@ ese He@@ z@@ bollah , according to CN@@ N .
the Syrian and Leban@@ ese media , as well as Ara@@ bic broad@@ ca@@ ster Al @-@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Lat@@ akia was fi@@ red upon during the night from Wednesday to Thursday , and the Israelis were identified as the responsible party .
Israeli television broad@@ ca@@ ster Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Lat@@ akia , in which Russian S @-@ 125 Ne@@ wa @-@ type defence missi@@ les and a battery of SA @-@ 3 missi@@ les could be seen , which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport war@@ heads weigh@@ ing up to 70 ki@@ lo@@ grams .
uns@@ ure , the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , press agency Re@@ u@@ ters has also quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack , but was not sure .
in any case , a spo@@ kes@@ person for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : &quot; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports . &quot;
journalist R@@ on Ben @-@ Y@@ is@@ ha@@ i , writing for daily newspaper Y@@ edi@@ oth A@@ hr@@ on@@ oth , emphasised that the Syrian regime had already previously attempted , in some cases successfully , to deliver ground to air missi@@ les to He@@ z@@ bollah .
the Israeli government had previously repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply He@@ z@@ bollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be crossing a &quot; red line , &quot; which would result in a military response .
John Ker@@ ry says US sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropriately &quot; in unprecedented admission
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a sof@@ tening of the U.@@ S &apos;s defen@@ sive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropriately . &quot;
the Secretary of State also admitted that he &apos;d been guilty , along with Barack Obama , of being on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; as incen@@ di@@ ary revel@@ ations from whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer Edward Snow@@ den about the N@@ SA &apos;s sp@@ ying activities emerged .
the le@@ aks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
speaking to an open government conference in London via video link , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &quot; there is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there , going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . &quot;
he then became the first high @-@ ranking member of the U.@@ S government to admit that US sp@@ ying had cros@@ sed the line , but emphasised that no one &apos;s rights had been ab@@ used .
he said : &quot; in some cases , it has reached too far in@@ appropriately . &quot;
and the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse .
I assure you innocent people are not being ab@@ used in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we &apos;re dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up . &quot;
there is radical extremis@@ m in the world that is hell @-@ bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments .
so what if you were able to inter@@ c@@ ept that and stop it before it happens ?
we have actually prevented air@@ planes from going down , buildings from being blo@@ wn up , and people from being assassin@@ ated because we &apos;ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans .
meanwhile , U.S. law@@ makers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. sp@@ ying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti @-@ terrorism efforts with the U.S. , the chairman of a Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs said on Thursday .
Sen@@ ator Chris Mur@@ ph@@ y of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti @-@ terrorist organizations because of fru@@ stration over surveillance by the National Security Agency .
&quot; it &apos;s really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti @-@ terrorism ende@@ a@@ vors , &quot; Mur@@ ph@@ y , a first @-@ term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub@@ committee on European Affairs , said in an interview from Washington .
and I &apos;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in comb@@ at@@ ting terrorism , not@@ with@@ standing their anger over these N@@ SA programs .
news reports that the N@@ SA swe@@ pt up millions of phone records in Europe have fra@@ yed relations with some U.S. allies , though the agency &apos;s chief said this week that they were in@@ accurate and reflected a mis@@ understanding of met@@ ad@@ ata that Nat@@ o allies collected and shared with the United States .
other revel@@ ations c@@ ited documents le@@ aked by Snow@@ den that the N@@ SA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cell@@ phone and those of up to 34 other world leaders .
the national intelligence director , James Cla@@ pper , defended sp@@ ying on allies as necessary and said it &apos;s comm@@ on@@ place on both sides .
am@@ id the u@@ pro@@ ar , Mur@@ ph@@ y said his office is arran@@ ging the con@@ gres@@ sional trip , expected to take place this year , and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both cham@@ bers .
names of other participating law@@ makers were to be released in coming days .
he said the itiner@@ ary is still being worked out .
while Mur@@ ph@@ y said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships , he said some &quot; tough love &quot; will also be disp@@ ens@@ ed .
he said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of es@@ pion@@ age programs they &apos;ve used for years themselves .
&quot; while we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans , they also need to come to terms with the fact that we &apos;re not the only ones that are out there sp@@ ying , &quot; Mur@@ ph@@ y said .
meanwhile , Mr Ker@@ ry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address ran@@ c@@ or over U.S. strategies in the Syria , Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities .

Ste@@ vie Ro@@ ch@@ elle Bam@@ ford was initially found guilty by a Ph@@ u@@ ket provin@@ cial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver , with two other men restra@@ ining her , carried out the ass@@ ault in the early hours of Sunday June 10 .
however , CC@@ TV foot@@ age later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian bo@@ y@@ friend .
Ph@@ u@@ ket police inter@@ viewed Bam@@ ford for two days before she conf@@ essed to fabri@@ c@@ ating the story .
she was held in local police cells before the court hearing .
Bam@@ ford was sent@@ enced to serve the 15 @-@ day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of Ph@@ u@@ ket rather than in an adult women &apos;s j@@ ail .
she is the daughter of former Australian le@@ ague player Peter tun@@ ks , who has appe@@ aled to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Can@@ ber@@ ra to assist his daughter .
tun@@ ks told Sydney &apos;s Sunday Tele@@ graph the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia .
&quot; it &apos;s obviously been a worrying time but we &apos;re hope@@ ful to have her back home safely as soon as possible , &quot; tun@@ ks said .
Bam@@ ford is appealing the sentence and has been granted b@@ ail of 50@@ ,000 bah@@ t .
reports in Australia said that in the meantime , she was holi@@ da@@ ying at the resort area of Kra@@ bi in Southern Thailand .
Thai @-@ based legal sources said Bam@@ ford was being represented by a local lawyer in Ph@@ u@@ ket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison .
however , following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Mich@@ elle Smith in Ph@@ u@@ ket , Thailand may also be looking to repair its batter@@ ed tourist image , leading to an acqu@@ it@@ tal .
