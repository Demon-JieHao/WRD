# Word Reordering Detection
This word reordering detection task is based on the following paper:
* Assessing the Abilites of Self-Attention Networks to Learn Word Order. Baosong Yang, Longyue Wang, Derek F. Wong, Lidia S. Chao and Zhaopeng Tu. In ACL 2019.
The main purpose is to study how well the word order information learned by different neural networks. Specifically, we randomly move one word to another position, and examine whether a trained model can detect both the original and inserted positions.
